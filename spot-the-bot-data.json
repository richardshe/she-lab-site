Starting from a dichlorophenyl pharmacophore identified through high-throughput screening, we developed pyrrolopyridine derivatives with nanomolar potency against TbPFK (IC₅₀ = 30 nM) and sub-micromolar parasiticidal activity. X-ray crystallography revealed that these compounds occupy a deep allosteric pocket adjacent to the active site, conferring exceptional species selectivity over human PFK isoforms. The inhibitors exhibit rapid parasite killing kinetics consistent with their mechanism of action. Lead compounds demonstrate favorable oral bioavailability, blood-brain barrier penetration, and efficacy in mouse infection models, achieving cure of acute infection with single-day oral dosing. These findings validate trypanosome PFK as a druggable target and establish a framework for exploiting divergent allosteric mechanisms in conserved metabolic enzymes.",

    "text": "Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), commonly known as sleeping sickness, remains a significant public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa despite substantial progress in disease control over the past two decades. The disease is caused by two subspecies of the parasitic protist Trypanosoma brucei: T. b. gambiense, responsible for the chronic form endemic to West and Central Africa, and T. b. rhodesiense, which causes an acute infection in East Africa. Transmission occurs through the bite of infected tsetse flies (Glossina spp.), and without treatment the disease is invariably fatal following progression to the second stage, in which parasites invade the central nervous system and cause the characteristic neurological disturbances from which the disease derives its name.\n\nCurrent therapeutic options for HAT are limited and problematic. Pentamidine and suramin, both developed in the early twentieth century, remain first-line treatments for stage 1 disease but cannot cross the blood-brain barrier effectively. Stage 2 disease has historically required treatment with melarsoprol, an arsenical compound with severe toxicity that kills approximately 5% of patients. The introduction of eflornithine and, more recently, the nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy (NECT) represented meaningful advances for T. b. gambiense infections, though these regimens require prolonged intravenous administration under clinical supervision. Fexinidazole, approved in 2018, provided the first all-oral treatment for both stages of gambiense HAT, yet concerns about efficacy in late-stage disease and the lack of effective oral treatments for rhodesiense HAT underscore the continued need for new therapeutic agents.\n\nThe bloodstream form of T. brucei presents a uniquely vulnerable metabolic target. Unlike most eukaryotes, which rely on oxidative phosphorylation for the bulk of ATP production, bloodstream trypanosomes are entirely dependent on glycolysis for energy generation. This metabolic simplification reflects the parasite's adaptation to the glucose-rich environment of mammalian blood, where substrate availability renders the more efficient but complex mitochondrial respiratory chain dispensable. The bloodstream form mitochondrion is indeed dramatically reduced, lacking a functional cytochrome-mediated electron transport chain and ATP synthase activity. Consequently, inhibition of glycolysis in bloodstream trypanosomes should rapidly deplete cellular ATP and prove lethal.\n\nGlycolytic enzymes have nonetheless been viewed as unattractive drug targets for several reasons. The pathway is ancient and highly conserved across all domains of life, with active site architectures that have remained essentially unchanged over billions of years of evolution. Designing inhibitors that discriminate between parasite and host enzymes at their catalytic sites would therefore appear exceptionally difficult. Furthermore, the substrates of glycolytic enzymes are phosphorylated sugars, and achieving competitive inhibition against such charged molecules presents substantial medicinal chemistry challenges related to cell permeability and drug-likeness. These considerations have historically directed drug discovery efforts toward other targets.\n\nHowever, while the catalytic mechanisms of glycolytic enzymes are conserved, their regulatory mechanisms are not. Allosteric control of metabolic flux has evolved independently in different lineages to meet organism-specific physiological demands. Phosphofructokinase (PFK), which catalyses the committed step of glycolysis—the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate—is subject to particularly elaborate allosteric regulation. In mammals, PFK activity is modulated by numerous effectors including ATP, citrate, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, and AMP, integrating signals about cellular energy status, biosynthetic demands, and hormonal state. The trypanosome enzyme, by contrast, operates under different selective pressures and has evolved distinct regulatory properties.\nTrypanosomatid PFK is further distinguished by its subcellular localisation. In T. brucei, the first seven enzymes of glycolysis, including PFK, are sequestered within specialised peroxisome-related organelles called glycosomes. This compartmentalisation is essential for parasite viability, as mislocalisation of glycolytic enzymes to the cytosol is lethal, likely due to uncontrolled ATP consumption and metabolic imbalance. The glycosomal environment may impose additional constraints on enzyme regulation that differ from those experienced by cytosolic PFKs in mammalian cells.\n\nStructural studies of trypanosomatid PFKs have revealed that these enzymes undergo conformational transitions between inactive (T-state) and active (R-state) forms, consistent with the classical Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of allosteric regulation. Critically, crystallographic analysis has identified allosteric pockets adjacent to the active site that are structurally distinct from those of mammalian PFKs. These sites represent potential targets for species-selective inhibition—an approach that circumvents the challenges of active site conservation by instead exploiting evolutionary divergence in regulatory mechanisms.\nIn this study, we describe the development of a series of small molecule allosteric inhibitors that selectively target T. brucei PFK. Using structure-based drug design guided by extensive crystallographic analysis, we have identified compounds that lock the enzyme in its inactive T-state conformation with nanomolar affinity while showing no inhibition of human PFK isoforms. The lead compounds exhibit rapid trypanocidal activity in vitro, cross the blood-brain barrier, and cure parasitaemia in a stage 1 mouse model of infection following single-day oral dosing. These findings establish proof of concept that glycolysis can be effectively and selectively targeted in parasitic infections, and suggest that allosteric inhibition may provide a general strategy for developing species-specific inhibitors of conserved metabolic enzymes.",

    "text": "The development of effective therapies against Human African Trypanosomiasis has been hampered by the limited druggable target space in Trypanosoma brucei and the particular challenge of achieving CNS penetration for stage 2 disease. The present study demonstrates that allosteric inhibition of phosphofructokinase represents a viable therapeutic strategy, overcoming the longstanding perception that glycolytic enzymes are intractable drug targets due to their conserved active sites and charged substrates.\nThe allosteric mechanism exploited here offers several distinct advantages over active site inhibition. Classical competitive inhibitors of glycolytic enzymes must contend with millimolar substrate concentrations and the inherent challenge of achieving selectivity against human orthologs that share nearly identical catalytic machinery. The dichlorophenyl pharmacophore identified through high-throughput screening occupies a deep allosteric pocket adjacent to, but distinct from, the ATP-binding site—a region where TbPFK and human PFK isoforms diverge substantially despite their shared enzymatic function. This finding aligns with the broader recognition that allosteric sites, being under less stringent evolutionary constraint than catalytic residues, frequently offer superior opportunities for species-selective inhibition (Christopoulos, 2002, Nat Rev Drug Discov).\n\nThe rapid parasite kill kinetics observed with the CTCB series—complete killing within 4–8 hours at therapeutically achievable concentrations—reflect the metabolic vulnerability of bloodstream form trypanosomes. Unlike mammalian cells with their metabolic flexibility, BSF T. brucei possesses a highly reduced mitochondrion incapable of oxidative phosphorylation, rendering glycolysis the sole source of ATP. Previous genetic studies established that even partial reduction of glycolytic flux is incompatible with parasite survival; the pharmacological data presented here corroborate this dependency and demonstrate that acute metabolic collapse can be achieved through targeted enzyme inhibition. The ATP depletion kinetics, with levels falling below 20% of baseline within two hours of treatment, are consistent with the known ATP turnover rates in trypanosomes and explain the observed cytocidal rather than cytostatic activity.\nThe thermodynamic characterization of CTCB compound binding provides mechanistic insight into their efficacy. The strongly favorable enthalpic contribution (ΔH = −13.6 kcal mol⁻¹ for CTCB-405) indicates extensive polar contacts and optimal shape complementarity within the allosteric pocket, consistent with the crystallographic observation of specific halogen bonding to Gly197 and hydrogen bonding to Asp199. The modest entropic penalty likely reflects conformational restriction upon binding and displacement of ordered water molecules. Importantly, the slow dissociation rates (k_off = 0.079 s⁻¹) translate to residence times of approximately 13 seconds—sufficient to maintain target engagement during physiological fluctuations in drug concentration and contributing to sustained pathway inhibition.\n\nA critical finding is the demonstration of blood-brain barrier penetration and CNS activity. The K_p value of 4.1 and K_p,uu of 0.6 for CTCB-405 indicate favorable brain distribution, with free drug concentrations in brain interstitial fluid reaching therapeutically relevant levels. This pharmacokinetic profile addresses a major limitation of existing HAT therapeutics; melarsoprol, while CNS-penetrant, carries unacceptable toxicity, whereas newer agents such as fexinidazole require extended dosing regimens. The reduction in brain parasitaemia observed in GVR35-infected mice treated during stage 2 disease provides proof-of-concept for CNS efficacy, though the failure to achieve sterile cure in this stringent model indicates that further optimization—whether through improved brain exposure, extended dosing, or combination approaches—will be necessary for late-stage disease.\n\nThe divergent outcomes between the Lister 427 and GVR35 infection models merit consideration. Complete cure with single-day dosing in the monomorphic model versus incomplete clearance in the pleiomorphic model likely reflects both the greater tissue dissemination of GVR35 parasites into adipose, skin, and other sanctuary sites, and potentially reduced drug access in extravascular compartments. This pattern echoes clinical experience with HAT therapeutics and underscores the importance of employing physiologically relevant infection models during drug development.\n\nSeveral aspects of the CTCB series support their advancement as clinical candidates. The high oral bioavailability (54–119%), favorable safety margins (40–110-fold selectivity over HepG2 cells), absence of P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux, and tolerance at doses up to 300 mg kg⁻¹ collectively indicate a viable therapeutic window. The species difference in microsomal stability—high stability in human but lower in mouse liver microsomes—may paradoxically favor clinical translation, as human pharmacokinetics could prove superior to those observed in murine efficacy studies.\n\nMore broadly, this work validates allosteric inhibition as a strategy for targeting essential metabolic enzymes in pathogens. The principles demonstrated here—exploiting evolutionary divergence at regulatory sites, leveraging metabolic dependencies unique to the pathogen's niche, and achieving rapid target engagement—may prove applicable to other glycolytic enzymes in trypanosomatids and beyond. Given the reliance of many proliferative diseases, including cancers, on aerobic glycolysis, the approach of species- or context-selective allosteric PFK inhibition warrants broader investigation.",

    "text": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 precipitated an unprecedented global health crisis, with the rapid spread of COVID-19 overwhelming healthcare systems and demanding urgent therapeutic interventions. In the absence of approved antiviral agents specifically targeting this novel betacoronavirus, clinicians and researchers turned to drug repurposing as the most expedient path toward treatment options. This approach, while pragmatic, carried an inherent tension: the imperative to deploy therapeutic candidates rapidly often outpaced the rigorous preclinical evaluation typically required to establish efficacy and appropriate dosing regimens in humans.\nFavipiravir (T-705; 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) emerged as a leading candidate for repurposing against SARS-CoV-2. Originally developed by Toyama Chemical Company and approved in Japan for treatment of novel or re-emerging influenza virus infections, favipiravir possesses broad-spectrum activity against RNA viruses spanning multiple families, including Flaviviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Filoviridae. The compound functions as a prodrug that undergoes intracellular phosphoribosylation to generate favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP), which serves as a substrate for viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Upon incorporation into nascent RNA strands, favipiravir-RTP induces chain termination and, critically, promotes the accumulation of transition mutations—predominantly G→A and C→U substitutions—through ambiguous base-pairing. This mutagenic activity can drive viral populations toward error catastrophe, a phenomenon termed lethal mutagenesis, wherein the mutation burden exceeds the threshold compatible with maintenance of functional viral genomes.\nThe mechanistic rationale for favipiravir activity against coronaviruses warranted careful consideration. Unlike most RNA viruses, coronaviruses encode a proofreading exonuclease (nsp14-ExoN) that confers replication fidelity approximately 15- to 20-fold higher than that of other RNA viruses. This proofreading capacity theoretically provides coronaviruses with partial resistance to mutagenic nucleoside analogues, as aberrantly incorporated nucleotides may be excised before becoming fixed mutations. Indeed, early in vitro studies examining favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2 revealed relatively modest antiviral potency, with EC₅₀ values in the high micromolar range—substantially higher than those observed against influenza viruses. Whether such concentrations could be safely achieved in vivo, and whether the mutagenic mechanism of action would remain operative against a proofreading-competent coronavirus, remained open questions requiring empirical investigation.\nThe Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has proven invaluable for COVID-19 antiviral research. Unlike standard laboratory mouse strains, which require genetic modification or mouse-adapted viral strains for productive SARS-CoV-2 infection, Syrian hamsters are naturally susceptible due to high homology between hamster and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Following intranasal inoculation, hamsters develop robust viral replication in the respiratory tract, transient viremia, weight loss, and pulmonary pathology recapitulating key features of human COVID-19, including broncho-interstitial pneumonia and vascular lesions. These characteristics render the hamster model suitable for evaluating both virological and clinical endpoints of antiviral therapy.\nHere, we present a comprehensive preclinical evaluation of favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2 in the Syrian hamster model. We assessed antiviral efficacy across multiple dosing regimens and therapeutic strategies—preemptive (treatment initiated at infection) and preventive (treatment initiated prior to infection)—using virological, clinical, and histopathological endpoints. We characterized the pharmacokinetics of favipiravir in this model, including plasma exposure and lung penetration, enabling comparison with drug concentrations achieved in human clinical trials. Finally, through whole-genome sequencing of viral populations recovered from treated animals, we investigated whether favipiravir exerts its antiviral effect through lethal mutagenesis despite the coronavirus proofreading machinery. Our findings provide essential preclinical data to inform the rational design of clinical trials evaluating favipiravir for COVID-19.",

    "text": "The development of effective antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 has been hampered by the rapid clinical deployment of repurposed drugs without adequate preclinical validation. Our findings establish that favipiravir exerts significant antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the Syrian hamster model, but only at doses that achieve plasma concentrations substantially higher than those typically attained with standard influenza dosing regimens. These results carry important implications for the ongoing clinical evaluation of this compound for COVID-19.\n\nThe dose-dependent reduction in pulmonary viral titers and histopathological severity we observed aligns with the established mechanism of favipiravir as a chain-terminating nucleoside analog and viral mutagen. The requirement for high doses—approaching or exceeding 1000 mg/kg/day—to achieve robust antiviral effects likely reflects the relatively modest in vitro potency of favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2, with EC₅₀ values in the hundreds of micromolar range, considerably higher than those reported for influenza virus. This disparity underscores a fundamental challenge in repurposing antivirals across viral families: effective concentrations derived from in vitro systems do not necessarily translate to achievable therapeutic exposures in vivo.\n\nOur pharmacokinetic analyses revealed marked non-linearity in favipiravir disposition, with accumulation ratios of 6- to 21-fold following repeated dosing. This non-proportional increase between doses is consistent with saturation of elimination pathways, as has been documented in human pharmacokinetic studies. Critically, lung tissue concentrations remained 1.6- to 2.7-fold lower than corresponding plasma levels, indicating that even with systemic drug accumulation, achieving adequate pulmonary exposure represents a significant pharmacological hurdle. The failure to detect favipiravir in lung tissue at the lowest dose tested (18.75 mg/day) provides a plausible explanation for the absence of antiviral efficacy at this dose level.\nDeep sequencing of viral genomes from treated animals provided mechanistic confirmation of favipiravir's mutagenic activity. The dose-dependent increase in mutation frequency—particularly the pronounced elevation in G→A transitions characteristic of favipiravir incorporation as a guanosine analog—demonstrates that the drug engages its expected mechanism of action in vivo. The negative correlation between non-synonymous mutation frequency and infectious viral titers supports the lethal mutagenesis hypothesis: favipiravir pushes the viral population toward an error catastrophe threshold beyond which replication-competent progeny cannot be sustained. Similar mutational signatures have been documented for favipiravir treatment of influenza, Ebola, and other RNA viruses, suggesting a conserved mechanism across diverse viral targets.\n\nThe observation that preventive administration yielded superior outcomes compared to preemptive (day-of-infection) treatment has direct clinical relevance. RNA virus replication kinetics typically favor early intervention, before viral populations achieve peak titers and tissue damage becomes established. In our model, viral loads peaked at 2-3 days post-infection, leaving a narrow therapeutic window. This temporal constraint likely explains why even high-dose favipiravir produced only partial viral suppression when initiated at the time of infection. For clinical translation, these data suggest that favipiravir, if effective, would be most beneficial as post-exposure prophylaxis or very early treatment rather than therapy for established disease.\n\nThe toxicity observed at the highest favipiravir dose (75 mg/day TID) warrants careful consideration. While this dose produced the most robust antiviral effects, signs of drug-related toxicity in treated animals raise concerns about the therapeutic index. Human pharmacokinetic studies have documented trough plasma concentrations of approximately 20-60 μg/mL with approved dosing regimens—values comparable to the lower end of our effective range but well below the exposures achieved at our highest dose. Whether dose escalation in humans could safely achieve the plasma concentrations associated with antiviral efficacy in our model remains an open question requiring dedicated pharmacokinetic and tolerability studies.\nSeveral limitations of this work merit consideration. The hamster model, while recapitulating key features of human COVID-19 pathophysiology including pneumonia and weight loss, differs from human infection in disease kinetics and immune responses. Intraperitoneal drug administration, while ensuring reliable systemic exposure, does not reflect clinical oral dosing. Additionally, our experiments employed a single viral strain; whether efficacy would be maintained against variants with altered polymerase fidelity or replication kinetics remains to be determined.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings provide preclinical evidence that favipiravir can suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication through its canonical mutagenic mechanism, but effective antiviral activity requires drug exposures at or near the limits of tolerability in this model. These results suggest that the therapeutic window for favipiravir in COVID-19 may be narrow and that clinical trials should incorporate pharmacokinetic assessments to determine whether adequate drug exposure is being achieved. More broadly, this work illustrates the essential role of rigorous preclinical evaluation in guiding the rational development of antiviral therapies.",

    "text": "The human nervous system presents a unique challenge in genome maintenance. Unlike most tissues, which rely on cellular turnover to replace damaged cells, neurons are largely postmitotic and must persist for the entire lifespan of the organism—potentially exceeding a century in humans. This extraordinary longevity places neurons in a precarious position: they cannot dilute accumulated genomic damage through replication, yet they remain metabolically active and transcriptionally engaged, processes that inherently generate genotoxic stress.\n\nDNA damage in neurons arises from multiple sources. Oxidative metabolism, particularly intense in the brain due to its high energy demands, generates reactive oxygen species that attack DNA bases and the sugar-phosphate backbone. Transcription itself creates torsional stress and transient single-stranded regions vulnerable to deamination and oxidation. Topoisomerase activity, essential for resolving transcription-associated supercoiling, can produce both single- and double-strand breaks when catalytic intermediates are trapped or aborted. The cumulative burden of these insults over decades poses a fundamental threat to neuronal function and survival.\n\nNeurons are not defenseless against this onslaught, but their repair options are constrained. Homologous recombination, the most accurate mechanism for repairing double-strand breaks, requires a sister chromatid template and is therefore largely unavailable in postmitotic cells. Instead, neurons rely predominantly on non-homologous end joining, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, and transcription-coupled repair mechanisms. These pathways, while functional, are inherently more error-prone or limited in scope than replication-associated repair. Moreover, mounting evidence indicates that DNA repair capacity declines with age across multiple pathways, potentially accelerating the accumulation of mutations and unrepaired lesions in aging neurons.\n\nThe consequences of inadequate DNA repair in neurons are evident in human disease. Hereditary deficiencies in DNA repair genes—including those encoding components of nucleotide excision repair (XP genes), single-strand break repair (TDP1, APTX), and double-strand break repair (ATM)—frequently manifest with prominent neurological phenotypes, ranging from progressive ataxia to neurodegeneration. Even in the absence of monogenic repair deficiencies, somatic mutations accumulate in aging neurons at rates that may contribute to functional decline and neurodegenerative disease. Single-cell sequencing studies have revealed that aged human neurons harbor thousands of somatic single-nucleotide variants, with mutation signatures suggesting oxidative damage and defective repair as primary contributors.\nDespite these observations, fundamental questions remain about how neurons organize their repair efforts across the genome. Do neurons repair damage uniformly, or do they prioritize certain genomic regions over others? The transcription-coupled repair pathway provides one precedent for selective maintenance: lesions that block RNA polymerase II elongation trigger dedicated repair responses that preferentially restore template strand integrity in expressed genes. However, whether neurons have evolved additional strategies to protect essential sequences—beyond canonical transcription-coupled repair—remains largely unexplored.\nSeveral lines of evidence suggest that such prioritization might exist. Studies in yeast and mammalian cells have demonstrated that chromatin state influences both damage susceptibility and repair efficiency, with actively transcribed regions generally experiencing faster repair kinetics. Histone modifications, nucleosome positioning, and the binding of transcription factors all modulate access to damaged DNA by repair machinery. In neurons specifically, activity-dependent transcription has been linked to programmed double-strand break formation at early response genes, mediated by topoisomerase IIβ, suggesting that some forms of DNA damage may be regulated rather than purely stochastic events.\n\nUnderstanding the genomic landscape of DNA repair in neurons has been technically challenging. Traditional approaches to mapping DNA damage and repair rely on sequencing-based detection of specific lesion types (such as 8-oxoguanine) or repair intermediates (such as single-strand breaks). While informative, these methods capture only subsets of the total repair activity occurring in a cell. A more comprehensive approach would detect the incorporation of new nucleotides during repair synthesis—a common endpoint of multiple repair pathways—thereby providing an unbiased view of where repair occurs across the genome.\n\nHere, we present Repair-seq, a method that maps DNA repair synthesis events by capturing genomic incorporation of the nucleoside analog 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) in postmitotic neurons. In proliferating cells, EdU incorporation primarily reflects replication; in neurons lacking S-phase, EdU labels sites of repair synthesis across multiple pathways that involve gap-filling DNA synthesis, including base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and long-patch processing of double-strand breaks. By enriching for EdU-containing DNA fragments and subjecting them to next-generation sequencing, we generate genome-wide maps of repair activity in human neurons derived from embryonic stem cells.\nOur findings reveal that DNA repair in neurons is not distributed uniformly but concentrated at discrete genomic hotspots. These DNA repair hotspots encompass a small fraction of the genome yet are enriched at promoters and gene bodies of genes essential for neuronal identity and function. Proteomic analysis identifies histone H2A variants and RNA-binding proteins as enriched at repair sites, suggesting links to chromatin organization and co-transcriptional processes. Strikingly, repair hotspots overlap with evolutionarily constrained elements and epigenetic clock CpG sites associated with biological aging, while somatic mutations in aged neurons accumulate elsewhere in the genome. These observations suggest that neurons have evolved mechanisms to preferentially protect their most essential sequences—and that disruption of this protective organization may contribute to age-related neurological decline.",

    "text": "The maintenance of genome integrity in postmitotic neurons represents a fundamental challenge in cellular biology. Unlike proliferating cells, which can dilute damaged DNA through replication or eliminate severely compromised cells through apoptosis, neurons must preserve their genomes across the human lifespan using only repair mechanisms. Our development of Repair-seq provides the first genome-wide map of active DNA repair in human neurons, revealing a surprisingly organized landscape of repair activity concentrated at discrete hotspots.\n\nThe identification of approximately 61,000 DNA repair hotspots covering only 1.6% of the genome suggests that neurons have evolved a strategic approach to genome maintenance. Rather than uniformly surveying the entire genome, repair machinery appears to be preferentially deployed to specific loci. This economy of repair resources may represent an adaptation to the metabolic constraints of maintaining billions of base pairs over decades of cellular life. The enrichment of DRHs at promoters, 5′-UTRs, and gene bodies indicates that transcriptionally active regions receive prioritized protection, consistent with models of transcription-coupled repair operating in postmitotic cells.\n\nHowever, our observation that DRH density does not correlate with expression levels complicates simple models of transcription-coupled repair. The enrichment of DRHs at genes essential for neuronal identity—regardless of their expression magnitude—suggests that neurons may have evolved mechanisms to recognize and protect functionally critical sequences. The paradoxical inverse relationship between gene length and DRH density further indicates that repair hotspots are not merely passive consequences of transcriptional activity. Instead, specific genomic features appear to nucleate repair machinery independently of transcription rate. The association of DRHs with large intronic genes suggests that challenges inherent to transcriptional elongation and splicing across extended genomic distances may create vulnerabilities requiring dedicated repair surveillance.\n\nThe proteomic identification of histone H2A variants and RNA-binding proteins at repair sites provides mechanistic insight into how DRHs may be established and maintained. H2AZ, validated by ChIP-seq at these sites, is known to mark regulatory elements and facilitate chromatin dynamics during transcription and repair. The enrichment of RNA-binding proteins suggests coupling between co-transcriptional RNA processing and DNA repair, potentially reflecting the need to coordinate resolution of R-loops, G-quadruplexes, and other non-B DNA structures that form during transcription of complex genes. The significant overlap between DRH-associated proteins and those dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease provides molecular candidates linking genome instability to neurodegeneration.\n\nOur findings regarding neuronal activity reveal unexpected complexity. While previous work in mice demonstrated that depolarization induces DSBs at early response genes through topoisomerase IIβ activity at CTCF sites, we observed minimal changes in human DRHs following KCl stimulation. Several explanations merit consideration. Species differences in chromatin organization or repair pathway utilization may account for this discrepancy. Alternatively, activity-induced breaks in human neurons may be repaired through pathways that do not incorporate EdU, such as direct ligation or microhomology-mediated end joining. The reduction of DRHs following TTX treatment nonetheless indicates that basal neuronal activity contributes to the establishment of repair hotspots, perhaps by maintaining chromatin accessibility or through the transcription-associated formation of secondary structures requiring ongoing surveillance.\n\nThe lack of enrichment of somatic mutations near DRHs in aged neurons initially appears paradoxical. If these sites receive enhanced repair attention, one might expect either enrichment (from error-prone repair) or depletion (from high-fidelity repair) of mutations. The random distribution of sSNVs suggests that mutations accumulate throughout the genome as repair capacity declines globally with age, while the hotspot architecture itself may prevent mutations at protected sites until late in the aging process. The strong association of DRHs with evolutionarily constrained elements supports this interpretation—these sequences have been under purifying selection across millions of years, and the repair machinery may have co-evolved to protect them.\n\nThe relationship between DRHs and the epigenetic aging clock provides a potential mechanistic link between genome maintenance and biological aging. Methylation changes at CpG dinucleotides are remarkably predictive of age yet lack a satisfying biological explanation. Our observation that age-associated CpG sites are closely associated with DRHs suggests that alterations in repair activity may drive methylation changes. DNA repair processes, particularly those involving single-strand breaks and base excision repair, can disrupt methylation patterns through several mechanisms. As repair capacity diminishes with age, the redistribution of limited repair resources away from clock-associated sites could permit methylation drift. The stability of DRHs overlapping with clock CpGs following DNA damage supports a model wherein these sites are preferentially protected until repair pathways become overwhelmed.\n\nSeveral limitations of our approach warrant acknowledgment. The use of EdU incorporation necessarily detects only repair synthesis events, missing direct ligation and other synthesis-independent repair pathways. ESC-derived neurons, while providing a tractable human model system, may not fully recapitulate the chromatin landscape and repair dynamics of neurons that have aged in vivo. Future studies using neurons from aged donors will be essential to determine how DRH architecture changes across the lifespan.\nIn conclusion, Repair-seq reveals that postmitotic human neurons concentrate DNA repair at discrete hotspots protecting essential genes and evolutionarily conserved sequences. This strategic deployment of repair resources may represent an adaptation enabling the remarkable longevity of human neurons. The association of repair hotspots with both the epigenetic clock and proteins dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease suggests that understanding the regulation of these sites may illuminate fundamental mechanisms of neural aging and neurodegeneration.",

    "text": "Colorectal cancer remains the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, accounting for nearly 900,000 deaths annually. Despite its substantial burden, CRC is among the most preventable cancers when detected early or at the precancerous adenoma stage, with five-year survival rates exceeding 90% for localized disease but declining precipitously to below 15% for distant metastases. This stark prognostic disparity has driven widespread implementation of population-based screening programs, which have demonstrably reduced CRC incidence and mortality in settings where uptake is high.\n\nCurrent screening guidelines in many countries recommend colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) for average-risk adults beginning at age 45–50 years. However, adherence to these recommendations remains suboptimal, with colonoscopy in particular hindered by patient concerns regarding invasiveness, bowel preparation, procedural discomfort, and resource limitations in healthcare systems. Moreover, uniform age-based screening strategies fail to account for the considerable heterogeneity in individual CRC risk, potentially subjecting low-risk individuals to unnecessary procedures while inadequately capturing high-risk individuals who might benefit from earlier or more intensive surveillance. Risk-stratified screening approaches, wherein the intensity and modality of surveillance are tailored to an individual's estimated risk, have therefore emerged as an attractive strategy to optimize resource allocation and improve screening efficiency.\n\nSeveral risk prediction models have been developed to identify individuals at elevated CRC risk, predominantly incorporating environmental risk factors and, more recently, genetic susceptibility variants. Environmental risk scores (ERSs) typically integrate modifiable lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, physical inactivity, and dietary patterns—all of which have established associations with CRC risk derived from large epidemiological studies. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) aggregate the effects of numerous common single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified through genome-wide association studies, each conferring modest individual risk but collectively capturing a meaningful proportion of heritable susceptibility. Both approaches hold conceptual appeal: ERSs identify modifiable targets for intervention, while PRSs capture stable, lifelong genetic predisposition. However, the discriminative performance of these scores in prospective settings has been disappointing, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) rarely exceeding 0.65, limiting their clinical utility for meaningful risk stratification.\n\nThe modest predictive capacity of existing models likely reflects the multifactorial etiology of CRC and the incomplete capture of relevant biological processes by current risk factors. This has motivated the search for novel biomarkers that more directly reflect the molecular alterations underlying colorectal carcinogenesis. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have attracted considerable attention in this regard. These small non-coding RNA molecules, typically 19–25 nucleotides in length, regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and participate in virtually all cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism. Importantly, miRNAs are released into the circulation via exosomes, microvesicles, and protein complexes, where they exhibit remarkable stability despite the presence of endogenous RNases. Tumor-derived miRNAs can be detected in blood at early disease stages, and distinct miRNA expression signatures have been associated with CRC in numerous case-control studies.\n\nMost investigations of circulating miRNAs in CRC have employed cross-sectional designs comparing patients with established disease to healthy controls. While such studies have identified promising candidate biomarkers, they are inherently limited in their ability to distinguish miRNA alterations that precede cancer development from those that arise as a consequence of existing malignancy. For a biomarker to be useful in risk stratification for screening, it must demonstrate altered expression in the pre-diagnostic period—ideally years before clinical presentation—reflecting early carcinogenic processes rather than tumor burden. Prospective cohort studies with pre-diagnostic sample collection are uniquely positioned to address this question but remain scarce owing to the logistical challenges of assembling large cohorts with extended follow-up and high-quality archived biospecimens.\n\nHere, we sought to derive and evaluate a blood-based miRNA panel for CRC risk prediction using pre-diagnostic serum samples from a well-characterized population-based cohort of older adults. We employed a two-phase approach: discovery of differentially expressed miRNAs via next-generation sequencing followed by validation and score development using quantitative PCR in an independent prospective sample set with up to 14 years of follow-up. Crucially, we directly compared the predictive performance of our miRNA-based risk score to that of an ERS incorporating established lifestyle factors and a PRS based on 140 CRC-associated genetic variants measured in the same individuals. This head-to-head comparison provides an unbiased assessment of the relative contributions of circulating miRNAs, environmental exposures, and genetic susceptibility to CRC risk prediction and offers insights into the potential of miRNA-based biomarkers for risk-stratified screening strategies.",

    "text": "This study demonstrates that a panel of seven circulating microRNAs measured in serum substantially outperforms both polygenic and environmental risk scores for predicting colorectal cancer occurrence up to 14 years before clinical diagnosis. The optimism-corrected AUC of 0.794 for the miR-score represents a marked improvement over the discriminative capacity achieved by the PRS (0.622) and ERS (0.557), and combining these genetic and lifestyle-based scores with the miRNA panel yielded only marginal additional benefit.\n\nThe superior predictive performance of circulating miRNAs likely reflects their capacity to capture dynamic biological processes underlying early carcinogenesis that static genetic variants and self-reported lifestyle factors cannot detect. Germline SNPs represent fixed inherited susceptibility, while environmental risk scores aggregate exposures that may have occurred decades prior to assessment. In contrast, circulating miRNAs are actively secreted by cells and can reflect ongoing pathophysiological changes in the colonic epithelium, including early proliferative alterations, inflammatory signaling, and stromal remodeling that precede overt malignancy. The consistent predictive performance observed across subgroups stratified by time to diagnosis—including samples collected more than three years before CRC detection—suggests that these molecular perturbations emerge early in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and persist throughout disease evolution.\n\nSeveral miRNAs in our panel have well-characterized mechanistic links to colorectal carcinogenesis. miR-92a-3p, a member of the miR-17-92 cluster, promotes cell proliferation and angiogenesis while suppressing apoptosis through targeting of PTEN and BIM; elevated circulating levels have been consistently associated with CRC in multiple prior studies (Huang et al., 2010; Ng et al., 2009). Similarly, let-7g-5p upregulation in our cases aligns with reports linking let-7 family dysregulation to aberrant RAS pathway activity and cell cycle progression. The strong positive coefficient for miR-23a-3p is concordant with its established role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion through targeting of metastasis suppressors.\n\nNotably, we observed downregulation of miR-21-5p and miR-19a-3p in pre-diagnostic samples, contrasting with the upregulation consistently reported in studies using samples collected at or after CRC diagnosis. This apparent discrepancy may reflect the distinct biology of pre-malignant versus established disease. miR-21 is among the most frequently overexpressed miRNAs in solid tumors and functions as an oncomiR by targeting tumor suppressors including PTEN and PDCD4; however, its elevation may occur predominantly during tumor progression rather than initiation. The observation by Wikberg and colleagues that miRNA profiles in pre-diagnostic samples differ substantially from those at diagnosis supports this interpretation and underscores the importance of using prospectively collected samples for biomarker discovery intended for risk stratification rather than diagnostic applications.\n\nThe modest discriminative ability of the PRS despite incorporating 140 validated susceptibility loci reflects a fundamental limitation of common variant-based genetic prediction: individually, these SNPs confer small effect sizes, and collectively they explain only a fraction of the heritable component of CRC risk. Our findings accord with previous evaluations demonstrating that PRS alone achieves insufficient discrimination for clinical risk stratification, with AUCs typically ranging from 0.55 to 0.65 in prospective cohorts. Similarly, environmental risk scores based on modifiable factors—while valuable for population-level prevention messaging—capture exposures incompletely and cannot account for gene-environment interactions or the biological integration of multiple risk pathways that miRNA profiles may reflect.\n\nOur study has several strengths, including its prospective design with long follow-up, use of pre-diagnostic samples, rigorous internal validation through bootstrap correction for optimism, and direct comparison of three complementary risk prediction approaches within the same population. The ESTHER cohort's recruitment through general practitioner visits provides a study population representative of the target demographic for CRC screening. Standardized sample collection, processing, and storage protocols minimize pre-analytical variability that has confounded many circulating miRNA studies.\n\nSeveral limitations warrant consideration. First, our panel was derived and validated within a single cohort, and external validation in independent populations with diverse demographic and clinical characteristics is essential before clinical implementation can be considered. Second, hemolysis affects circulating miRNA quantification, and while we excluded samples with significant hemolysis, subtle contamination from blood cell miRNAs cannot be entirely excluded. Third, normalization strategies for circulating miRNA studies remain unstandardized, and our selection of three miRNAs as endogenous normalizers, while empirically justified, may not generalize to other platforms or populations. Fourth, we lacked information on polyp history and detailed colonoscopy findings for most participants, precluding evaluation of the miR-score's ability to detect advanced adenomas—a critical consideration for any screening-oriented biomarker.\n\nThe clinical implications of these findings center on the potential for blood-based miRNA testing to stratify population screening intensity. Individuals with low miR-scores might be appropriate candidates for less intensive surveillance strategies, while those with elevated scores could be prioritized for colonoscopy, potentially improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of screening programs. However, several practical hurdles must be addressed, including standardization of pre-analytical variables, establishment of quality control procedures for clinical laboratories, and determination of optimal score thresholds balancing sensitivity and specificity for the intended clinical application.\n\nIn conclusion, a seven-miRNA signature measured in serum demonstrates strong predictive capacity for CRC occurrence in a prospective cohort setting, substantially outperforming established polygenic and environmental risk scores. These findings support continued development of circulating miRNA panels as tools for CRC risk stratification, while highlighting the need for external validation, standardization of analytical methods, and evaluation of clinical utility in screening contexts.",

    "text": "The developmental regulation of human hemoglobin expression represents one of the most intensively studied paradigms of gene switching in mammalian biology. During ontogeny, humans undergo two major transitions in β-like globin gene expression: from embryonic ε-globin to fetal γ-globin during the first trimester, and subsequently from γ-globin to adult β-globin around the time of birth. This latter transition, commonly termed the fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switch, has profound clinical implications. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF, α₂γ₂) possesses a higher oxygen affinity than adult hemoglobin (HbA, α₂β₂) and, critically, can functionally compensate for defective or absent β-globin chains in patients with β-hemoglobinopathies.\nSickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia represent the most common monogenic disorders worldwide, affecting millions of individuals predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and South Asia. SCD arises from a single nucleotide substitution in the β-globin gene (Glu6Val), producing hemoglobin S (HbS), which polymerizes under deoxygenated conditions, causing erythrocyte sickling, vaso-occlusion, chronic hemolysis, and progressive organ damage. β-thalassemia results from mutations that reduce or abolish β-globin synthesis, leading to α-globin chain excess, ineffective erythropoiesis, and transfusion-dependent anemia. Remarkably, both conditions are ameliorated by elevated HbF levels, as demonstrated by the relatively mild clinical course observed in patients with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH)—naturally occurring mutations that prevent developmental γ-globin silencing.\n\nThe therapeutic potential of HbF induction has driven decades of research into the molecular mechanisms governing γ-globin repression. Several transcription factors have emerged as central regulators of the fetal-to-adult switch. BCL11A, identified through genome-wide association studies as a major quantitative trait locus for HbF levels, functions as a potent repressor of γ-globin transcription and has become a leading therapeutic target. Erythroid-specific deletion of BCL11A robustly induces HbF expression, and clinical trials employing CRISPR-based disruption of the erythroid BCL11A enhancer have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in patients with SCD and β-thalassemia. Additional repressors include LRF/ZBTB7A, which binds directly to γ-globin promoter sequences, and KLF1, whose reduced activity in HPFH patients contributes to sustained γ-globin expression through diminished BCL11A activation.\n\nSOX6 has been established as another critical component of the γ-globin silencing machinery. Studies have demonstrated that SOX6 cooperates with BCL11A and GATA1 to co-occupy the human β-globin locus, alter its chromatin conformation, and silence γ-globin transcription during erythroid maturation. The NuRD chromatin remodeling complex, recruited by BCL11A and other repressors, provides the enzymatic activities—histone deacetylation and nucleosome remodeling—necessary for establishing a repressive chromatin environment at the γ-globin promoters.\n\nDespite substantial progress, the regulatory network controlling γ-globin silencing remains incompletely characterized. The γ-globin proximal promoter contains several cis-regulatory elements whose disruption causes HPFH, including an octamer binding motif (ATGCAAAT) located at positions –182 to –175 relative to the transcription start site. The –175 T→C HPFH mutation within this octamer disrupts binding of certain transcriptional regulators and results in persistent γ-globin expression in adults. However, the identity of repressive factors that normally occupy this element and contribute to developmental silencing has remained unclear.\n\nNonO (non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein), also known as p54nrb, is a multifunctional nuclear protein initially characterized for its ability to recognize the octamer motif in immunoglobulin gene promoters. NonO participates in diverse nuclear processes including transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and DNA repair, and is an essential structural component of paraspeckles—subnuclear bodies implicated in the retention and regulation of specific RNA species. Notably, NonO has been identified as a component of the NuRD complex and has been observed to colocalize with BCL11A in nuclear paraspeckles. These observations, combined with the presence of an octamer motif in the γ-globin promoter, prompted us to investigate whether NonO might participate in γ-globin gene regulation.\nHere, we report that NonO functions as a novel transcriptional repressor of human γ-globin expression. We demonstrate that NonO interacts directly with SOX6 and binds to the octamer motif in the γ-globin proximal promoter. Depletion of NonO in human erythroid cell lines and primary erythroid progenitors significantly elevates γ-globin expression. Furthermore, conditional deletion of NonO in adult mice carrying the human β-globin locus (β-YAC mice) reactivates both murine embryonic globins and human γ-globin, indicating an evolutionarily conserved role in developmental globin gene silencing. These findings identify NonO as a new component of the γ-globin repression network and suggest it may represent an additional therapeutic target for HbF induction in patients with β-hemoglobinopathies.",

    "text": "The developmental silencing of fetal hemoglobin represents one of the most clinically consequential gene regulatory events in human biology, and its reversal remains a central goal of therapeutic strategies for sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia. In this study, we identify NonO as a novel transcriptional repressor of γ-globin expression that functions through direct binding to the proximal promoter and physical interaction with the established silencing factor SOX6.\n\nOur finding that NonO binds the octamer motif ATGCAAAT in the γ-globin promoter adds an important new element to the emerging picture of how multiple repressive complexes converge on this locus. BCL11A occupies a distal TGACCA motif, while SOX6 binds the proximal promoter despite the absence of a canonical SOX binding sequence—a puzzling observation that our data now help explain. The direct protein-protein interaction between NonO and SOX6, mediated through multiple SOX6 domains including the leucine zipper and HMG box, suggests that NonO may serve as a critical anchor that recruits or stabilizes SOX6 at the γ-globin promoter. This model is consistent with the synergistic repression observed in our luciferase assays when both factors were co-expressed.\n\nThe involvement of NonO in γ-globin silencing is particularly intriguing given its known association with paraspeckles and its identification as a component of the NuRD complex. Notably, NonO has been reported to colocalize with BCL11A in paraspeckles, raising the possibility that these nuclear bodies may serve as organizational hubs for assembling γ-globin repressive machinery. The co-identification of SFPQ, the obligate NonO heterodimerization partner, in our mass spectrometry analysis further supports a role for paraspeckle-associated proteins in hemoglobin switching. Whether paraspeckle integrity is required for efficient γ-globin silencing warrants future investigation.\n\nThe magnitude of γ-globin derepression upon NonO knockdown—approximately 90-fold in primary adult erythroid progenitors—is striking and comparable to effects observed with depletion of BCL11A itself. This robust response, combined with the elevation of HbF-positive cells detected by flow cytometry, positions NonO as a functionally significant repressor rather than a minor modulatory factor. Importantly, NonO depletion did not perturb erythroid differentiation, as evidenced by normal CD71/Glycophorin A profiles, suggesting that NonO's role in γ-globin silencing can be dissociated from potential effects on erythropoiesis more broadly.\n\nOur in vivo studies using conditional NonO knockout mice carrying the human β-globin locus provide compelling evidence for evolutionary conservation of this silencing mechanism. The reactivation of both human γ-globin transgenes and endogenous murine embryonic globins (εy and βh1) upon NonO deletion demonstrates that NonO functions in developmental globin silencing across mammalian species. This conservation suggests that NonO's repressive function predates the divergence of primate-specific γ-globin regulation and may reflect an ancient mechanism for silencing embryonic/fetal globin programs.\n\nThe observation that the −175 T-to-C mutation, which disrupts the NonO binding motif, paradoxically increased promoter activity rather than simply abolishing repression deserves consideration. This HPFH-associated mutation creates a de novo binding site for the GATA1-TAL1 activating complex, which may explain the gain of function. However, our data suggest an additional possibility: that NonO and SOX6 may normally sequester or exclude activators from the wild-type promoter, such that their displacement upon motif disruption permits activator access. This model aligns with the established capacity of NonO to function as either a repressor or activator depending on genomic context.\n\nFrom a therapeutic perspective, these findings identify NonO as a potential target for HbF reactivation. However, several considerations temper enthusiasm for direct NonO inhibition. NonO is a multifunctional protein with roles in splicing, DNA repair, circadian regulation, and innate immunity—functions that would likely preclude systemic targeting. More promising may be strategies that disrupt the NonO-SOX6 interaction specifically, or that target NonO recruitment to the γ-globin promoter without ablating its other cellular functions. The detailed domain mapping of the SOX6-NonO interaction presented here provides a foundation for such approaches.\n\nIn conclusion, our study establishes NonO as an essential component of the γ-globin silencing apparatus that operates through direct promoter binding and cooperation with SOX6. These findings expand our understanding of the multi-layered transcriptional control governing hemoglobin switching and may inform future therapeutic strategies aimed at HbF reactivation for the treatment of β-hemoglobinopathies.",

    "text": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has transformed the treatment of hematological malignancies, yet its efficacy against solid tumors remains limited. Multiple barriers impede CAR-T cell function in the solid tumor microenvironment (TME), including poor infiltration, immunosuppressive myeloid populations, inadequate costimulation, and the development of T cell exhaustion. Moreover, the heterogeneous expression of target antigens in solid tumors creates opportunities for immune escape through antigen loss, a resistance mechanism that undermines therapies targeting single surface molecules.\nThese challenges have prompted efforts to engineer CAR-T cells with enhanced intrinsic functionality. Strategies have included modifications to costimulatory domains, incorporation of cytokine signaling, and optimization of CAR affinity to improve persistence and effector function. However, approaches focused solely on augmenting cell-autonomous CAR-T cell properties cannot address the fundamental problem of antigen heterogeneity. Tumors that lose or downregulate the CAR target antigen evade recognition regardless of how potent the engineered T cells may be.\n\nAn alternative strategy involves harnessing CAR-T cells not merely as direct tumor killers but as vehicles for reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment to promote endogenous antitumor immunity. Pattern recognition receptor (PRR) agonists represent attractive candidates for this purpose, as they can activate innate immune pathways that bridge to adaptive responses. Agonists of cytosolic RNA sensors such as RIG-I and MDA5 induce type I interferon (IFN-I) production and can promote dendritic cell (DC) maturation, potentially licensing endogenous T cell responses against tumor antigens beyond those targeted by the CAR.\n\nHowever, PRR activation is a double-edged sword. Work from our laboratory and others has demonstrated that IFN-I signaling within cancer cells can paradoxically promote tumor progression and immunosuppression. Chronic or cancer cell-intrinsic IFN signaling drives expression of immune checkpoint ligands and other inhibitory molecules that dampen antitumor immunity. This creates a therapeutic dilemma: while PRR agonists may stimulate productive immune responses when sensed by immune cells, off-target activation in cancer cells can be counterproductive. Conventional delivery methods, including intratumoral injection or systemic administration of PRR agonists, do not discriminate between these cellular compartments.\n\nRN7SL1 is an endogenous RNA component of the signal recognition particle that, when unshielded from its normal protein partners, functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) capable of activating RIG-I and MDA5. Unlike synthetic RNA agonists, RN7SL1 possesses distinctive structural features—including extensive secondary structure requiring both RNA sensors for full signaling—that may tune the magnitude and quality of PRR activation. We previously demonstrated that stromal cell-derived RN7SL1 can be transferred to breast cancer cells via exosomes, where it promotes an inflammatory and therapy-resistant phenotype. This observation raised the question of whether RN7SL1 transfer could instead be redirected toward immune cells to achieve beneficial immunostimulation.\n\nHere, we engineer CAR-T cells to express and deploy RN7SL1 through extracellular vesicles (EVs). We hypothesized that this approach would accomplish two objectives: first, cell-intrinsic PRR activation would enhance CAR-T cell expansion and effector differentiation; second, selective transfer of RN7SL1 to tumor-infiltrating immune cells—rather than cancer cells—would reprogram the myeloid compartment and license endogenous T cell responses capable of controlling antigen-loss variants. We demonstrate that RN7SL1-armed CAR-T cells achieve durable solid tumor control in both xenograft and syngeneic models, and that this efficacy depends on the recruitment of endogenous immunity through RIG-I/IFN-I signaling in bone marrow-derived cells. Furthermore, we show that CAR-T cells can be engineered to co-deliver RN7SL1 with peptide antigens, enabling the \"painting\" of poorly immunogenic tumors to recruit broad T cell responses even when tumors lack adequate neoantigens.",

    "text": "This study demonstrates that engineering CAR-T cells to express the endogenous immunostimulatory RNA RN7SL1 addresses several fundamental limitations constraining adoptive cell therapy against solid tumors. By exploiting the dual signaling properties of RN7SL1—its cell-autonomous enhancement of CAR-T cell function and its capacity for selective delivery to tumor-infiltrating immune cells via extracellular vesicles—we have developed a platform that simultaneously improves transferred cell persistence while recruiting productive endogenous anti-tumor immunity.\n\nThe preferential accumulation of CAR-T cell-derived EVs in immune cells rather than tumor cells represents a critical mechanistic insight. Previous work established that RIG-I activation in cancer cells can paradoxically promote tumor progression and immunotherapy resistance (Benci et al., 2016; Nabet et al., 2017). Our finding that EV-mediated delivery circumvents this liability while preserving immunostimulatory signaling in myeloid and dendritic cell populations provides a solution to what has been a significant obstacle in deploying PRR agonists therapeutically. The molecular basis for this selectivity—whether reflecting differential EV uptake receptor expression, membrane fusion properties, or other mechanisms—warrants further investigation and may inform broader strategies for immune-selective cargo delivery.\n\nThe divergent downstream effects of RN7SL1 versus scrambled RNA, despite both activating type I interferon responses, underscore the importance of PRR signaling specificity beyond simple pathway engagement. The requirement for both RIG-I and MDA5 for full RN7SL1 activity, compared to the single-receptor dependence of scrambled RNA, suggests that the coordinated engagement of multiple cytosolic sensors produces qualitatively distinct transcriptional and cellular outcomes. This distinction manifests functionally in the restriction of MDSC development, reduction of TGF-β expression, and promotion of DC subsets with favorable costimulatory profiles—effects not recapitulated by scrambled RNA despite equivalent ISG induction. These findings align with emerging appreciation that innate immune receptor activation patterns, rather than simple on/off states, determine immunological outcomes (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010).\n\nThe demonstration that RN7SL1-armed CAR-T cells can reject tumors with heterogeneous CAR antigen expression addresses one of the most clinically significant mechanisms of resistance to adoptive cell therapy (Gardner et al., 2016; Sotillo et al., 2015). By recruiting endogenous T cells against non-CAR tumor antigens such as TRP2, this approach effectively converts a monoclonal therapeutic intervention into a polyclonal anti-tumor response. The generation of protective memory against CAR-antigen-negative rechallenge further indicates that this endogenous immunity is durable. These findings suggest that measuring endogenous T cell responses may serve as a biomarker for therapeutic efficacy in future clinical applications.\n\nThe capacity to co-deliver peptide antigens alongside RN7SL1 extends this platform to tumors lacking adequate neoantigens—a common feature of human cancers with low mutational burden. Our proof-of-concept experiments with SIINFEKL demonstrate that CAR-T cells can effectively provision the tumor microenvironment with both adjuvant and antigen, converting immunologically \"cold\" tumors into substrates for productive T cell priming. This modular approach could be adapted to incorporate tumor-associated antigens, personalized neoantigens, or shared antigens, potentially guided by antigen discovery pipelines or computational neoantigen prediction.\n\nSeveral considerations will shape translation of these findings. First, our reliance on syngeneic mouse models, while essential for evaluating endogenous immunity, leaves uncertain whether the same selective EV delivery and immune activation occur in human tumors. Second, the requirement for ICB to fully manifest endogenous immunity in poorly immunogenic tumors suggests that combination approaches will be necessary clinically. Third, the scope of peptide antigens and other cargo amenable to this delivery strategy remains to be systematically defined. Finally, although we observed no obvious toxicities, comprehensive safety evaluation—including assessment of potential autoimmunity arising from enhanced endogenous T cell responses—will be essential.\n\nIn summary, RN7SL1-armed CAR-T cells represent a multi-functional platform that enhances cell-autonomous function, remodels the tumor myeloid compartment, and recruits endogenous adaptive immunity. This integrated approach offers a path toward overcoming the interconnected barriers that have limited CAR-T cell efficacy in solid malignancies.",

    "text": "Human mobility—the movement of individuals across geographic space—represents a fundamental determinant of numerous phenomena spanning public health, economics, urban planning, and social dynamics. The spatial and temporal patterns of human travel directly influence infectious disease transmission, as pathogens exploit human movement networks to colonize new populations. Beyond epidemiology, mobility patterns shape economic activity through labor market dynamics and trade flows, determine accessibility to healthcare facilities and educational resources, and underpin transportation infrastructure planning. Consequently, accurate characterization and prediction of human movement constitutes a critical need across multiple disciplines.\n\nDirect measurement of population-level mobility has historically proven challenging, particularly in resource-limited settings. Traditional approaches including travel surveys and census data collection are costly, logistically demanding, and typically capture only snapshots of movement behavior. The proliferation of mobile phone technology has transformed this landscape, enabling passive collection of mobility data at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Call detail records (CDRs), generated when subscribers make calls or send messages, provide georeferenced timestamps that permit inference of individual trajectories when aggregated appropriately. This data source has proven particularly valuable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where mobile phone penetration often exceeds that of other communication infrastructure.\n\nWhen empirical mobility data remain unavailable or incomplete, researchers have relied upon spatial interaction models to estimate travel patterns. These mathematical frameworks predict movement between locations based on geographic and demographic characteristics. The gravity model, drawing conceptual inspiration from Newtonian physics, posits that travel between two locations increases with their population sizes and decreases with the distance separating them. First formalized for migration studies in the mid-twentieth century, gravity models have since been applied extensively to predict commuting patterns, trade flows, and disease spread. The model's intuitive appeal and minimal data requirements—requiring only population counts and inter-location distances—have ensured its widespread adoption.\n\nAlternative formulations have emerged to address perceived limitations of the gravity framework. The radiation model, introduced by Simini and colleagues in 2012, incorporates intervening opportunities between origin and destination, hypothesizing that travelers select destinations based on the distribution of opportunities encountered rather than distance per se. Unlike the gravity model, the radiation model requires no parameter fitting, instead deriving predictions directly from population distributions. Comparative evaluations have yielded mixed results regarding which approach better captures empirical mobility patterns, with performance appearing to depend on geographic context and spatial scale.\n\nA critical gap in the literature concerns the validation of these modeling frameworks in LMIC settings. The majority of model development and testing has occurred in high-income countries, predominantly in Europe and North America, where infrastructure, urbanization patterns, and socioeconomic conditions differ substantially from those in developing regions. Sub-Saharan Africa presents a particularly important test case given the region's distinctive characteristics: predominantly rural populations, heterogeneous infrastructure development, and spatial distributions of economic activity that may not conform to assumptions embedded in standard models. Transportation networks in many African countries remain limited, with road quality varying dramatically between urban centers and rural peripheries. These factors may fundamentally alter how distance and population influence travel decisions.\n\nThe distinction between urban and rural areas merits particular consideration. Standard gravity and radiation models treat all locations equivalently, yet substantial evidence suggests that mobility patterns differ systematically based on the urbanicity of origins and destinations. Urban areas serve as economic and social hubs that attract travelers from surrounding rural regions, while rural-to-rural travel may follow distinct patterns shaped by agricultural activities, kinship networks, and limited transportation options. Similarly, administrative boundaries—often corresponding to ethnic, linguistic, or historical divisions—may modulate travel in ways not captured by distance alone. Intra-regional travel connecting locations within the same administrative unit may be facilitated by shared governance, transportation planning, and social ties, whereas inter-regional travel may face additional barriers.\n\nThe implications of model selection extend beyond academic interest. Epidemiological models incorporating human mobility to predict disease spread rely upon accurate movement estimates; systematic biases in mobility inputs propagate through to intervention recommendations. During the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014–2016 and the COVID-19 pandemic, mobility models informed predictions of geographic spread and evaluations of travel restrictions. Resource allocation decisions—placement of health facilities, distribution of vaccines, deployment of community health workers—similarly depend upon understanding how populations access services. If standard models systematically misestimate travel patterns in rural African settings, the downstream consequences for policy and planning may be substantial.\n\nHere, we address these gaps by analyzing human mobility patterns derived from mobile phone data across four Sub-Saharan African countries: Namibia, Kenya, Burkina Faso, and Zambia. These nations span a range of population densities, urbanization levels, and geographic characteristics, providing a diverse testbed for model evaluation. We first characterize empirical mobility patterns, examining how trip frequencies vary with distance, population, and the urban or rural character of origins and destinations. We then evaluate the performance of gravity and radiation models in reproducing observed patterns, testing whether model fit can be improved by allowing parameters to vary based on trip characteristics. Specifically, we assess whether distinguishing trips by urbanicity (travel between urban and rural locations), by region (within versus between administrative regions), or by both factors simultaneously yields superior predictions. Our findings reveal systematic patterns that challenge assumptions embedded in standard models and identify modifications that substantially improve predictive accuracy. These results have immediate relevance for researchers and practitioners requiring mobility estimates in data-sparse settings and contribute toward a more nuanced understanding of human movement in diverse geographic contexts.",

    "text": "Our analysis of mobile phone-derived mobility data from four Sub-Saharan African countries reveals that standard gravity models, while widely employed in infectious disease modeling and public health planning, systematically misestimate travel patterns in these settings. The most striking finding is that model performance improves substantially when parameters are allowed to vary by trip type—particularly when accounting for both regional boundaries and urbanicity of origin and destination locations. This suggests that the assumptions underlying basic gravity models, originally developed to describe commuting patterns in high-income, predominantly urban contexts, do not translate straightforwardly to the heterogeneous landscapes characteristic of many low- and middle-income countries.\n\nThe observation that intra-regional travel constitutes a disproportionate share of total movement—ranging from 30% in Burkina Faso to 72% in Zambia—has important implications for applications such as disease transmission modeling. Standard gravity formulations, which treat distance as the primary determinant of travel friction, cannot capture the administrative, cultural, or infrastructural factors that make regional boundaries meaningful predictors of movement. The marked improvement in model fit when regional parameters are incorporated suggests that these boundaries represent genuine discontinuities in mobility behavior, not merely artifacts of spatial autocorrelation. This aligns with ethnographic and sociological literature documenting how ethnic, linguistic, and economic ties often cluster within administrative regions in Sub-Saharan Africa, creating mobility networks that do not follow simple distance-decay relationships.\n\nThe differential performance of urbanicity adjustments across countries provides insight into how population distribution shapes mobility patterns. Kenya, with the highest proportion of urban districts (56%) and the largest share of urban-to-urban travel (70%), showed substantial improvement when urbanicity was incorporated into the model. Conversely, Zambia—despite having similarly high urbanization levels by some metrics—showed improvement only when a lower urbanicity threshold was applied. This sensitivity to threshold definition highlights the difficulty of applying standardized urban/rural classifications across diverse contexts. The rapid urbanization occurring throughout Sub-Saharan Africa is producing settlement patterns that defy simple binary classifications, with peri-urban areas and secondary cities exhibiting mobility characteristics distinct from both traditional rural villages and major metropolitan centers.\n\nThe poor performance of the radiation model in three of four countries warrants careful interpretation. Radiation models, which incorporate intervening opportunities rather than simple distance decay, have been proposed as parameter-free alternatives to gravity models. However, their underlying assumption—that travelers select destinations based on the total population within a certain radius—may be poorly suited to contexts where population distribution is highly heterogeneous and where major destinations (such as capital cities) exert disproportionate attractive force regardless of intervening population. The superior performance of the radiation model in Kenya, which has a more evenly distributed population than the other three countries, supports this interpretation.\n\nOur finding that rural-to-rural travel is systematically overestimated by basic gravity models has direct relevance for infectious disease applications. Many gravity model implementations in epidemiology assume that population size is the primary driver of both trip generation and attraction. In predominantly rural settings, however, travel may be more constrained by transportation infrastructure, economic necessity, and seasonal agricultural patterns than by population size per se. Overestimating rural mobility could lead to inflated predictions of disease spread into remote areas, potentially misallocating surveillance resources or overestimating intervention requirements. Conversely, accurate characterization of the relative isolation of rural communities could inform more targeted vaccination or vector control strategies.\n\nSeveral limitations of this analysis merit consideration. Mobile phone data, while increasingly available, remain an imperfect proxy for human movement. Subscriber populations may not be representative of the general population, particularly in areas with low mobile penetration or where phone sharing is common. The aggregation of data to administrative level 2 districts may obscure finer-scale mobility patterns relevant to some applications. Additionally, our analysis focused on trip counts rather than individual-level movement trajectories, precluding examination of factors such as trip duration, frequency, or purpose that may differentially affect disease transmission or other outcomes of interest.\n\nThe cross-country variation in model performance underscores the challenge of developing universally applicable mobility models for low- and middle-income settings. While the regional-urbanicity model consistently outperformed simpler alternatives, the magnitude of improvement varied substantially—from 16% reduction in DIC for Zambia to 41% for Namibia. This heterogeneity suggests that no single model structure will be optimal across all contexts, and that model selection should ideally be informed by local validation data when available. Where such data are unavailable, our results suggest that incorporating both regional boundaries and urbanicity classifications will generally improve estimates, though the specific parameterization may need to be adapted based on the characteristics of the study area.\n\nThese findings have practical implications for researchers and public health practitioners who must model human mobility in data-limited settings. When mobility data are unavailable for model fitting, our results suggest that applying gravity models fitted in other low- and middle-income settings—particularly those with similar urbanization levels and population distributions—may produce more accurate estimates than using parameters derived from high-income contexts. More broadly, this work adds to the growing recognition that spatial interaction models developed in one context cannot be uncritically applied in another, and that investment in mobility data collection and model validation in underrepresented regions remains a priority for global health research.",

    "text": "The maintenance of genome integrity is fundamental to cellular homeostasis and organismal survival. Among the various forms of DNA damage, double-strand breaks (DSBs) represent the most cytotoxic lesions, as their improper repair can lead to chromosomal rearrangements, loss of genetic information, and malignant transformation. Cells have evolved two principal pathways for DSB repair: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which directly ligates broken DNA ends, and homologous recombination (HR), which uses a sister chromatid as a template to faithfully restore the original sequence (Symington & Gautier, 2011; Chapman et al., 2012). The choice between these pathways is tightly regulated across the cell cycle, with HR predominating in S and G2 phases when sister chromatids are available.\n\nCentral to HR is the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2, whose germline mutations account for a substantial proportion of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer cases (Wooster et al., 1995; Tavtigian et al., 1996). BRCA2 functions as a mediator protein that facilitates the loading of the RAD51 recombinase onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) generated by nucleolytic resection of DSB ends. RAD51 displaces the ssDNA-binding protein RPA and assembles into nucleoprotein filaments that catalyze the search for homologous sequences and subsequent strand invasion—the defining steps of HR (San Filippo et al., 2008; Jensen et al., 2010). BRCA2 accomplishes this task through its eight BRC repeats, which bind RAD51 monomers, and its C-terminal DNA-binding domain, which interacts with both ssDNA and dsDNA (Yang et al., 2002; Esashi et al., 2007). The essential nature of BRCA2 function is underscored by the embryonic lethality of homozygous knockout mice and the profound sensitivity of BRCA2-deficient cells to DNA-damaging agents, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors now used clinically (Bryant et al., 2005; Farmer et al., 2005).\n\nDespite detailed structural and biochemical characterization of BRCA2-RAD51 interactions, less is understood about how BRCA2 activity is regulated in response to DNA damage. The DNA damage response (DDR) is orchestrated by the apical kinases ATM and ATR, which phosphorylate hundreds of substrates on SQ/TQ motifs to coordinate cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis (Matsuoka et al., 2007; Blackford & Jackson, 2017). BRCA2 itself contains multiple SQ/TQ sites, several of which have been identified as ATM/ATR substrates in phosphoproteomic studies, yet the functional significance of most of these phosphorylation events remains unclear.\n\nProtein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major serine/threonine phosphatase that counterbalances kinase activity across diverse cellular processes. PP2A holoenzymes consist of a scaffolding A subunit, a catalytic C subunit, and one of several regulatory B subunits that confer substrate specificity and subcellular localization (Janssens & Goris, 2001; Seshacharyulu et al., 2013). The B56 family of regulatory subunits (comprising α, β, γ, δ, and ε isoforms) directs PP2A to substrates containing LxxIxE short linear motifs, a recognition mechanism that has emerged as a widespread mode of PP2A-B56 substrate recruitment (Hertz et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). PP2A-B56 has established roles in mitotic regulation, including the control of kinetochore-microtubule attachments and the spindle assembly checkpoint, but its functions in DNA repair remain incompletely characterized.\n\nHere, we identify a functional interaction between BRCA2 and PP2A-B56 mediated by a highly conserved LxxIxE motif located between BRC repeats 1 and 2. We show that ATM and ATR phosphorylate SQ/TQ sites flanking this motif in response to DSBs, thereby enhancing PP2A-B56 binding. This phosphorylation-dependent BRCA2-PP2A-B56 complex is recruited to sites of DNA damage and is required for efficient RAD51 filament formation and HR. We further demonstrate that cancer-associated BRCA2 variants within this region dysregulate PP2A-B56 binding and confer sensitivity to PARP inhibition. Our findings establish PP2A-B56 as a positive regulator of BRCA2 function and reveal a novel regulatory axis linking DDR signaling to HR-mediated repair with potential therapeutic implications.",

    "text": "Our findings establish PP2A-B56 as a critical positive regulator of BRCA2 function during homologous recombination. We demonstrate that ATM and ATR kinases phosphorylate a highly conserved region flanking the LxxIxE motif in BRCA2, thereby stimulating formation of a BRCA2-PP2A-B56 complex that is essential for efficient RAD51 filament formation and HR-mediated DNA repair.\n\nThe phosphoregulation of the BRCA2-PP2A-B56 interaction represents a compelling example of kinase-phosphatase crosstalk in the DNA damage response. ATM and ATR are among the earliest responders to DSBs, and our data indicate that their phosphorylation of BRCA2 at S1123 and T1128 enhances PP2A-B56 recruitment with an eight-fold increase in binding affinity when both sites are modified. This arrangement suggests a feed-forward mechanism: DNA damage activates ATM/ATR, which in turn promotes assembly of the repair machinery by facilitating the BRCA2-PP2A-B56 interaction. The observation that both the 3AQ (non-phosphorylatable) and 3DQ (phosphomimetic) mutants exhibit reduced viability and MMC sensitivity compared to wild-type BRCA2 implies that dynamic, reversible phosphorylation—rather than constitutive modification—is required for optimal BRCA2 function. This may reflect a need for temporal regulation of PP2A-B56 recruitment during different phases of HR.\n\nThe identity of PP2A-B56 substrates relevant to HR remains an open question. PP2A-B56 could directly dephosphorylate BRCA2 itself, creating a local negative feedback loop that fine-tunes BRCA2 activity. Alternatively, PP2A-B56 may target other components of the recombination machinery. RAD51, RPA, and PALB2 are all phosphoproteins whose modification states influence HR efficiency, and any of these could represent physiological substrates. The requirement for PP2A-B56 in RAD51 focus formation suggests that relevant substrates act at or upstream of the strand invasion step. Identifying these targets will be essential for understanding how phosphatase activity promotes recombination.\n\nOur findings add to an emerging appreciation of phosphatase function in genome maintenance. While kinases have long been recognized as central regulators of the DNA damage response, phosphatases were historically viewed as merely reversing kinase action in a non-specific manner. The discovery of short linear motifs that direct PP2A-B56 to specific substrates has transformed this view, revealing that phosphatases participate in precise regulatory circuits. The conservation of the BRCA2 LxxIxE motif across 450 million years of vertebrate evolution underscores its functional importance and suggests that the BRCA2-PP2A-B56 axis represents an ancient and fundamental aspect of HR regulation.\n\nThe clinical implications of our work are twofold. First, we show that cancer-associated BRCA2 variants within the B56-interacting region can dysregulate PP2A-B56 binding and sensitize cells to PARP inhibition. Notably, these variants exert their effects through distinct mechanisms: S1106R and T1116P enhance binding, while T1128I diminishes it. That both increased and decreased PP2A-B56 affinity compromise BRCA2 function reinforces the conclusion that precisely tuned, dynamic regulation is essential. These findings may inform the clinical classification of BRCA2 variants of uncertain significance, particularly those mapping to this conserved region. Second, the sensitivity of cells with dysregulated BRCA2-PP2A-B56 interactions to PARP inhibitors suggests potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. Tumors harboring mutations in either BRCA2 or PP2A-B56 subunits may exhibit HR defects that could be exploited with DNA-damaging agents or PARP inhibitor therapy.\n\nIn summary, we have uncovered a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism by which PP2A-B56 is recruited to BRCA2 following DNA damage, promoting RAD51 filament formation and HR. This work expands our understanding of how the DNA damage response coordinates kinase and phosphatase activities to maintain genome integrity and has implications for the clinical management of BRCA2-associated cancers.",

CHK1 suppression induced DNA double-strand breaks, evidenced by γH2AX accumulation, and correlated with poor patient survival.

    "text": "Activating mutations in KRAS are among the most prevalent oncogenic drivers in human malignancies, occurring in approximately 30% of all cancers and reaching particularly high frequencies in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (>90%), colorectal cancer (~45%), and non-small cell lung cancer (~30%). These mutations lock KRAS in its GTP-bound active state, resulting in constitutive activation of downstream signaling cascades—most notably the RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways—that promote uncontrolled proliferation, survival, and metabolic reprogramming. Despite decades of intensive research, KRAS remained largely \"undruggable\" until recent advances yielded covalent inhibitors targeting the KRAS^G12C^ variant. However, these agents address only a subset of KRAS-mutant tumors, and resistance emerges rapidly, underscoring the continued need for alternative therapeutic strategies.\n\nOne consequence of oncogene-driven hyperproliferation is the generation of replicative stress, a state characterized by stalled or collapsed replication forks, accumulation of single-stranded DNA, and activation of the DNA damage response. Oncogenic KRAS signaling induces replicative stress through multiple mechanisms: it accelerates S-phase entry while simultaneously depleting nucleotide pools, creates conflicts between replication and transcription machinery, and generates reactive oxygen species that damage DNA directly. To tolerate this intrinsic genomic instability, KRAS-mutant cells become dependent on DNA damage checkpoint pathways that would otherwise trigger cell cycle arrest or apoptosis—a phenomenon that represents a potential therapeutic vulnerability.\n\nCheckpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as a central effector of the replicative stress response. Upon sensing DNA damage or replication fork stalling, the upstream kinase ATR phosphorylates and activates CHK1, which then coordinates a multifaceted protective response. CHK1 enforces S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints by phosphorylating and inactivating the CDC25 phosphatases, preventing premature CDK activation. Beyond checkpoint control, CHK1 stabilizes stalled replication forks, suppresses origin firing to prevent further fork collisions, and facilitates homologous recombination repair. These functions are essential for maintaining genomic integrity during normal DNA replication but become particularly critical in the context of oncogene-induced replicative stress.\n\nThe concept of non-oncogene addiction posits that cancer cells, while driven by specific oncogenic mutations, become dependent on stress-support pathways that are not themselves oncogenic but are necessary to tolerate the cellular stresses accompanying transformation. CHK1 exemplifies such a dependency in the context of oncogenic RAS. Studies have demonstrated that KRAS-transformed cells exhibit elevated basal levels of DNA damage markers and heightened reliance on CHK1 activity compared to their non-transformed counterparts. Genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of CHK1 selectively compromises the viability of RAS-mutant cells, suggesting that targeting this checkpoint kinase could provide a therapeutic window sparing normal tissues.\n\nSeveral CHK1 inhibitors have entered clinical development, though their advancement has been complicated by dose-limiting toxicities and modest single-agent activity. The identification of rational combination strategies and predictive biomarkers for patient selection remains an active area of investigation. Understanding the mechanistic basis of CHK1 dependency in specific oncogenic contexts—including how upstream signaling pathways regulate CHK1 expression and activity—may inform more effective therapeutic approaches.\n\nIn this study, we sought to elucidate the relationship between oncogenic KRAS signaling and CHK1 dependency. Using isogenic cell line models with inducible or constitutive KRAS^G12V^ expression, we demonstrate that oncogenic KRAS upregulates CHK1 expression through MEK-ERK pathway signaling and the downstream transcription factors ETS1 and ELK1. KRAS-transformed cells exhibit elevated DNA damage at baseline and are selectively sensitized to CHK1 inhibition, which induces catastrophic DNA damage, S-phase arrest, and apoptosis. We further show that KRAS mutation status correlates with CHK1 inhibitor sensitivity across large cancer cell line panels and that CHK1 inhibition suppresses the growth of KRAS-mutant tumor xenografts. These findings establish a mechanistic link between oncogenic KRAS and CHK1 dependency and support the clinical development of CHK1 inhibitors for KRAS-mutant malignancies.",

    "text": "The therapeutic intractability of KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer remains one of the most pressing challenges in oncology. While the recent clinical success of KRAS^G12C^ inhibitors has validated direct KRAS targeting as a viable strategy, the near-complete dominance of G12D and G12V mutations in PDAC necessitates alternative approaches. Our findings establish CHK1 as a critical dependency in KRAS-mutant PDAC and reveal an intricate signaling network connecting the DNA damage response, ERK-MAPK signaling, and autophagy that can be exploited therapeutically.\n\nThe identification of ATR-CHK1 pathway components as modulators of ERK inhibitor sensitivity through unbiased genetic screening underscores a fundamental biological principle: oncogenic KRAS imposes replicative stress that renders cells dependent on DDR machinery for survival. This dependency, first conceptualized as \"non-oncogene addiction,\" creates a therapeutic window wherein DDR inhibition preferentially kills cancer cells while sparing normal tissue. Our demonstration that CHK1 inhibition alone induces apoptotic growth suppression—with concurrent loss of MYC expression—suggests that KRAS-mutant PDAC cells operate near a threshold of tolerable DNA damage. The correlation between CHK1 inhibitor sensitivity and MYC loss is particularly noteworthy given MYC's established role in both replication licensing and DNA damage tolerance; CHK1 inhibition may thus collapse a MYC-dependent transcriptional program essential for managing oncogene-induced replicative stress.\n\nA central finding of this study is the compensatory activation of ERK and AMPK signaling following CHK1 inhibition. This adaptive response exemplifies the signaling plasticity that has frustrated single-agent targeted therapies across cancer types. The ERK activation we observed likely represents an attempt by cells to restore proliferative capacity and may additionally support DNA repair through ERK-dependent transcriptional programs. Indeed, our discovery that ERK inhibition downregulates RIF1—a critical mediator of 53BP1-dependent non-homologous end joining—reveals a previously unappreciated connection between mitogenic signaling and DSB repair pathway choice. RIF1's emergence as the top hit in our ERK substrate CRISPR screen, and the demonstration that RIF1 depletion phenocopies ERK inhibition in sensitizing cells to CHK1 inhibitors, suggests that ERK sustains NHEJ capacity as a backup repair mechanism when homologous recombination is compromised by CHK1 inhibition.\n\nThe concurrent upregulation of autophagy following CHK1 inhibition adds another dimension to the adaptive response. Autophagy serves multiple pro-survival functions in KRAS-mutant cells, including metabolic support, clearance of damaged organelles, and maintenance of the amino acid pools required for continued proliferation under stress. Our finding that the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine synergizes with CHK1 inhibition extends the concept of autophagy as an inducible resistance mechanism beyond our previous observations with ERK inhibitors. The superior efficacy of triple CHK1/ERK/autophagy inhibition—with minimal toxicity to non-transformed cells—suggests that simultaneous blockade of multiple compensatory pathways may be required to achieve durable responses in PDAC.\n\nOur observation that CHK1 expression decreases following ERK inhibition, and that this occurs secondary to G₁ arrest rather than through direct transcriptional regulation, has important mechanistic implications. CHK1 expression is cell-cycle regulated, with peak levels in S phase when its checkpoint functions are most critical. ERK inhibition-induced G₁ arrest thus creates a state of reduced CHK1 expression that may prime cells for enhanced sensitivity to subsequent CHK1 inhibition. This temporal relationship suggests that sequential or metronomic dosing strategies might optimize the therapeutic index of combination regimens.\n\nSeveral limitations of this study warrant consideration. Our analyses were conducted primarily in established cell lines, though validation in patient-derived organoids strengthens translational relevance. The relative contributions of CHK1 versus ATR inhibition require further delineation; while both showed similar combination effects, the broader substrate repertoire of ATR may produce distinct biological consequences. Additionally, the in vivo pharmacology of triple combination regimens—including potential overlapping toxicities—remains to be evaluated.\n\nFrom a translational perspective, our findings provide rationale for clinical evaluation of CHK1 or ATR inhibitors in combination with ERK pathway and autophagy inhibitors in KRAS-mutant PDAC. The ongoing clinical development of hydroxychloroquine combinations with MEK/ERK inhibitors provides an established framework into which DDR inhibitors could be incorporated. While CHK1 inhibitor development has stalled, the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib remains in active clinical development and showed comparable combination efficacy in our studies. The identification of RIF1 as a mediator of resistance additionally suggests potential biomarker strategies, though direct pharmacological targeting of RIF1 is not currently feasible.\n\nIn summary, we demonstrate that CHK1 inhibition exposes a network of compensatory survival mechanisms in KRAS-mutant PDAC that can be targeted through rational combination therapy. The convergence of DDR, MAPK signaling, and autophagy pathways on cell survival creates opportunities for synthetic lethal approaches that may finally translate the genetic vulnerabilities of PDAC into therapeutic benefit.",

    "text": "The vertebrate tail represents a remarkable example of axial elongation driven by a self-renewing progenitor population residing in the tail bud. Unlike the trunk, where distinct developmental compartments are established during gastrulation, tail formation depends on the continued activity of bipotent neuromesodermal progenitors that progressively contribute to both spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm as the embryo elongates posteriorly (Tzouanacou et al., 2009; Kimelman, 2016). The tail bud thus functions as a specialized organizer, coordinating the differentiation and spatial segregation of axial structures—notochord, somites, and neural tube—in an environment constrained by diminishing progenitor pools and the absence of surrounding extraembryonic tissues.\n\nCentral to tail bud organization are transcription factors that govern the specification and migration of mesodermal cell populations. The homeobox gene noto (also known as floating head in zebrafish) is essential for notochord differentiation and maintenance of midline identity. Loss of noto function results in transfating of axial mesoderm toward paraxial fates, producing ectopic somitic tissue at the expense of the notochord (Talbot et al., 1995; Halpern et al., 1995). Conversely, the bHLH transcription factor Mesogenin1 (msgn1) operates in the presomitic mesoderm to promote paraxial identity and epithelialization of nascent somites (Yoon & Wold, 2000; Yoon et al., 2000). Studies in mouse and zebrafish have demonstrated that msgn1 mutants exhibit severe segmentation defects, though the phenotypic severity varies considerably across species, likely reflecting differential genetic redundancy with related factors such as spadetail (spt/tbx16) and tbx6 (Fior et al., 2012; Chalamalasetty et al., 2014).\n\nDespite substantial progress in understanding trunk mesoderm patterning, the molecular mechanisms governing tail-specific development remain incompletely characterized. Several lines of evidence suggest that trunk and tail mesoderm are regulated by overlapping yet distinct genetic programs. The tail bud harbors a unique population of progenitors that must simultaneously maintain stemness and feed differentiating tissues under progressively restrictive conditions. Moreover, morphological constraints differ markedly: in teleosts with large yolks, epiboly must traverse considerable distances, and tail bud formation often initiates before epiboly completion, potentially sensitizing posterior development to perturbations that would be buffered in the trunk. Whether genes such as noto and msgn1 play enhanced or specialized roles in the tail bud compared to trunk mesoderm has been difficult to address, particularly given the genetic redundancy that masks phenotypes in conventional model organisms.\n\nForward genetic screens in zebrafish and medaka have been instrumental in identifying components of vertebrate developmental pathways, yet these approaches face practical limitations. Maintaining large mutant collections, performing outcrosses for mapping, and achieving saturation mutagenesis require substantial infrastructure and labor. These constraints are particularly acute for screens targeting parental-effect genes, which require four generations before phenotypic assessment. Alternative vertebrate systems that simplify genetic analysis while retaining developmental conservation would therefore be valuable complements to established models.\n\nThe mangrove killifish, Kryptolebias marmoratus, offers unique advantages for vertebrate genetics. This remarkable cyprinodontiform is the only known self-fertilizing hermaphroditic vertebrate, producing offspring through internal fertilization of eggs by sperm generated within the same individual (Harrington, 1961; Tatarenkov et al., 2009). Prolonged self-fertilization generates highly homozygous, isogenic strains—laboratory stocks maintained for decades approach 99.97% homozygosity at polymorphic loci. This genetic uniformity dramatically simplifies mutation identification: candidate variants can be identified against an effectively invariant background without the need for outcrossing, linkage mapping, or extensive sequencing depth. Furthermore, homozygous mutant lines arise directly from mutagenized hermaphrodites, eliminating the need to recover heterozygous carriers and establish complementation crosses. The close phylogenetic relationship between K. marmoratus and medaka (Oryzias latipes) provides an additional advantage, as morpholino knockdown and mRNA rescue experiments can be performed in medaka embryos—which are readily accessible at the one-cell stage—to validate candidate genes identified in killifish mutants.\n\nHere, we characterize two ENU-induced mutants in K. marmoratus, designated shorttail (stl) and balltail (btl), which exhibit distinct defects in posterior axial development. Using pooled RNA sequencing from isogenic mutant and wild-type embryos, we rapidly identified the causative mutations as lesions in noto and msgn1, respectively, without recourse to genetic mapping or a fully assembled reference genome. Morpholino knockdown in medaka recapitulates the killifish phenotypes and reveals that these transcription factors play essential, non-redundant roles in directing cell sorting between axial and paraxial compartments of the tail bud. Our findings demonstrate that the mangrove killifish provides a powerful system for forward genetics and illuminate conserved yet tail-enhanced functions of noto and msgn1 in vertebrate posterior development.",

    "text": "The present study establishes the self-fertilizing mangrove killifish Kryptolebias marmoratus as a powerful vertebrate model for forward genetic analysis and provides new mechanistic insights into the reciprocal regulatory interactions governing axial-paraxial cell fate decisions during tail bud development. By exploiting the near-isogenic nature of self-fertilizing strains, we demonstrate that causative mutations can be identified from a single lane of RNA-seq without recourse to linkage mapping or a reference genome—a substantial methodological advance that could democratize forward genetic screens in emerging model organisms.\n\nThe identification of noto and msgn1 as the causative genes underlying the stl and btl phenotypes, respectively, aligns with and extends previous work in zebrafish and mouse. The noto gene encodes a homeodomain transcription factor first characterized in zebrafish as floating head (flh), where loss-of-function mutations result in conversion of notochord precursors to paraxial mesoderm fate (Talbot et al., 1995; Amacher & Kimmel, 1998). Similarly, mouse Noto mutants display notochord defects and posterior truncations (Abdelkhalek et al., 2004). Our stl mutant phenocopies these defects, confirming evolutionary conservation of Noto function across teleosts and tetrapods. The R187C missense mutation lies within a conserved C-terminal domain, suggesting this region is critical for Noto transcriptional activity or protein-protein interactions.\n\nThe msgn1 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor essential for paraxial mesoderm specification and the segmentation clock. Zebrafish msgn1 morphants exhibit severe somitogenesis defects with cells failing to undergo proper epithelialization (Yoo et al., 2003; Fior et al., 2012). Mouse Msgn1 knockouts similarly show loss of paraxial mesoderm derivatives and expansion of axial tissues (Yoon & Wold, 2000). The I114N mutation in our btl mutant disrupts a conserved residue within the leucine zipper dimerization domain, likely abolishing the capacity for homo- or heterodimerization required for DNA binding.\n\nA key finding of our study is the demonstration of reciprocal antagonism between Noto and Msgn1 in regulating cell fate allocation within the tail bud. Loss of noto function results in downregulation of msgn1, while loss of msgn1 leads to ectopic noto expression—and vice versa. This mutual repression establishes a bistable switch that sharpens the boundary between axial and paraxial domains. The Kaede photoconversion experiments in medaka morphants provide direct evidence that this transcriptional antagonism translates into altered cell sorting behaviors: noto morphant cells fail to populate the midline notochord and instead contribute to paraxial territories, whereas msgn1 morphant cells accumulate ectopically along the midline. The double morphant phenotype, characterized by severe disruption of both axial and paraxial cell deposition, underscores the requirement for balanced activity of both factors in orchestrating proper tail elongation.\n\nThese observations are consistent with the broader principle that mutually antagonistic transcription factor pairs establish and maintain distinct tissue domains during development—a regulatory logic exemplified by the Pax6/Nkx2.1 boundary in the forebrain (Puelles & Rubenstein, 2003) and the Olig2/Irx3 interface in the spinal cord (Briscoe & Ericson, 2001). In the tail bud, Noto and Msgn1 appear to fulfill an analogous role, with their reciprocal inhibition ensuring robust segregation of axial versus paraxial fates even in the face of developmental noise.\n\nFrom a methodological standpoint, the RNA-seq-based mutation identification pipeline we describe offers several advantages over traditional positional cloning approaches. The highly inbred nature of K. marmoratus strains—a consequence of constitutive self-fertilization—dramatically reduces background polymorphism and enables causative mutations to be distinguished from neutral variants with minimal sequencing depth. Moreover, because recessive mutations segregate in the F2 generation from a single self-fertilizing F1 parent, the screening process is shortened by one generation relative to outcrossing species. These features make K. marmoratus particularly well-suited for small-scale, hypothesis-driven mutagenesis screens targeting specific developmental processes or organ systems.\n\nSeveral limitations of the current study warrant acknowledgment. First, the functional validation experiments were performed in medaka rather than K. marmoratus itself, owing to technical difficulties in obtaining synchronized one-cell stage embryos for microinjection. While the conserved morphant phenotypes strongly support our gene assignments, future development of injection protocols or CRISPR-based mutagenesis in K. marmoratus would enable direct genetic manipulation in this species. Second, our analysis focused on two mutant lines from a limited pilot screen; broader saturation mutagenesis would likely uncover additional components of the tail bud regulatory network.\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that K. marmoratus provides a tractable system for forward genetic dissection of vertebrate development. The stl and btl mutants reveal that Noto and Msgn1 function as mutual antagonists to balance axial and paraxial cell fate specification in the tail bud—a regulatory relationship that appears conserved across teleosts and likely extends to other vertebrate lineages. As genomic and transcriptomic resources for this species continue to expand, we anticipate that the mangrove killifish will become an increasingly valuable complement to established models for investigating the genetic basis of embryonic development.",

    "text": "Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasitic protist Trypanosoma brucei. Transmitted by the tsetse fly, the parasite colonizes the haemolymphatic system in the first stage of the disease before crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to invade the central nervous system (CNS) in the second stage. While recent advances in therapy have improved the outlook for patients, the need for novel therapeutic targets remains high to ensure sustainable elimination and to address potential resistance.\n\nThe bloodstream form (BSF) of T. brucei presents a unique metabolic vulnerability. Unlike the insect vector form or mammalian host cells, the BSF parasite relies exclusively on glycolysis for the production of ATP. Lacking a functional Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, the parasite is wholly dependent on the rapid flux of glucose through the glycolytic pathway to maintain viability. It is a long-established observation that the withdrawal of glucose from the parasite's environment leads to rapid loss of motility and cell death within minutes. Consequently, the glycolytic pathway has long been proposed as a \"metabolic Achilles' heel\" of the trypanosome, theoretically offering an ideal target for therapeutic intervention.\n\nDespite this clear biological rationale, glycolytic enzymes have historically been regarded as intractable or \"undruggable\" targets. This reluctance stems primarily from two factors. First, the glycolytic pathway is one of the oldest and most conserved metabolic pathways in biology; the active sites of glycolytic enzymes share high sequence and structural identity across eukaryotes and prokaryotes, raising significant concerns regarding selectivity and host toxicity. Second, the substrates of these enzymes are phosphorylated sugars or nucleotides. Designing small molecule inhibitors that mimic these charged substrates while maintaining sufficient lipophilicity to cross cell membranes—and in the case of trypanosomes, the glycosomal membrane—presents a formidable medicinal chemistry challenge.\n\nHowever, while the catalytic machinery of glycolysis is highly conserved, the regulatory mechanisms governing the pathway have diverged significantly to suit the specific biological niches of different organisms. Phosphofructokinase (PFK), a key \"gatekeeper\" enzyme controlling glycolytic flux, exemplifies this divergence. Mammalian PFKs are large homotetramers (monomer size ~85 kDa) characterized by complex allosteric regulation tailored to the metabolic needs of multicellular tissues. In contrast, T. brucei PFK (TbPFK) is a significantly smaller protein (monomer size ~53 kDa) with distinct regulatory properties. This structural and functional divergence suggests that while the active sites may be similar, the allosteric sites utilized for enzyme regulation may provide unique pockets for species-specific inhibition.\n\nIn this study, we exploit these evolutionary differences to validate trypanosome glycolysis as a viable drug target. We describe the structure-based design and development of a novel class of small-molecule allosteric inhibitors—the CTCB series—that target a unique allosteric pocket on TbPFK. We demonstrate that these compounds lock the enzyme in an inactive conformation, effectively blocking glycolytic flux and inducing rapid ATP depletion and parasite death. Crucially, these inhibitors are exquisitely selective for the parasite enzyme, showing no activity against human PFK isoforms. Furthermore, we show that these compounds possess favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and can clear parasitaemia in a murine model of HAT. This work not only provides a potential therapeutic lead for sleeping sickness but also establishes a broader proof-of-concept: that the targeting of divergent allosteric mechanisms can unlock highly conserved metabolic pathways for anti-infective drug discovery.",

    "text": "The development of new therapeutics for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) has long been hampered by the challenge of identifying targets that are both essential for the parasite and sufficiently distinct from human orthologues to ensure safety. In this study, we provide pharmacological validation of the glycolytic pathway as a druggable target in Trypanosoma brucei through the development of the CTCB series—potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitors of T. brucei phosphofructokinase (TbPFK). Our findings challenge the historical view that glycolytic enzymes are poor drug targets due to active site conservation, demonstrating instead that species-specific allosteric inhibition is a viable and effective strategy.\n\nA central finding of this work is the structural elucidation of the allosteric mechanism governing TbPFK inhibition. While the active sites of human and trypanosome PFKs share high similarity, contributing to the difficulty of active-site inhibitor design, we exploited the significant divergence in regulatory mechanisms between the species. Mammalian PFKs are large tetramers regulated by a complex array of effectors binding to domains absent in the parasite enzyme. In contrast, our crystallographic data reveal that TbPFK is controlled by a distinct, smaller allosteric pocket. The CTCB compounds function by locking the enzyme in a rigid, inactive T-state, preventing the conformational changes necessary for catalytic activity. This mechanism explains the exquisite selectivity observed; the inhibitors exhibited no measurable activity against human PFK isoforms, thereby mitigating the risk of mechanism-based toxicity.\n\nThe physiological consequence of this blockade is a rapid and catastrophic failure of parasite metabolism. The bloodstream form of T. brucei lacks a functional Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, relying exclusively on glycolysis for ATP production. Consequently, inhibition of PFK leads to an immediate cessation of glycolytic flux. This metabolic vulnerability is reflected in the time-to-kill (TTK) assays, where the CTCB compounds induced >99% parasite death within 30 minutes. This rapid cytocidal activity contrasts sharply with current standard-of-care agents and other developmental candidates, such as fexinidazole or oxaboroles, which typically require exposure times exceeding 20 hours to achieve comparable killing. The speed of action is a highly desirable trait for HAT therapeutics, as it may reduce the duration of dosing regimens required for cure and limit the window for resistance development.\n\nDespite the rapid killing kinetics observed in vitro, our washout experiments indicated that a slightly prolonged exposure (2–4 hours) is necessary to ensure sterile culture conditions. This discrepancy suggests the presence of a subpopulation of parasites with reduced metabolic demand or distinct cell-cycle dynamics that temporarily tolerate glycolytic blockade. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetic profile of the lead compounds, particularly CTCB-405, proved sufficient to translate this potency into in vivo efficacy. The compounds demonstrated excellent oral bioavailability and, crucial for the treatment of stage 2 HAT, the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The unbound brain-to-plasma ratio ($K_{p,uu}$) of 0.6 indicates significant penetration into the interstitial fluid of the CNS, a historically difficult compartment to access pharmacologically.\n\nIn the acute stage 1 murine model (Lister 427), a short, one-day oral dosing regimen of CTCB-405 was sufficient to achieve a sterile cure. This represents a significant improvement over many existing treatments that require prolonged administration. However, in the more stringent GVR35 model of stage 2 infection, while we observed a substantial reduction in parasite burden in both the periphery and the CNS, a sterile cure was not achieved with the specific dosing regimen tested. This difference likely reflects the increased virulence and tissue sequestration characteristic of the pleiomorphic GVR35 strain, as well as the potential for parasites to occupy privileged niches within the CNS or adipose tissue where drug concentrations may be suboptimal. The clear reduction of parasitemia in the brain confirms the intrinsic activity of the class against CNS-resident parasites, suggesting that optimization of the dosing schedule or combination with other agents could yield a curative regimen for late-stage disease.\n\nIn conclusion, this study establishes TbPFK as a validated target for anti-trypanosomal drug discovery. We have identified a class of fast-acting, allosteric inhibitors that successfully cross the blood-brain barrier and cure acute infection in mice via oral administration. Beyond HAT, these results have broader implications for drug discovery against other kinetoplastid diseases and eukaryotic pathogens. They underscore the potential of targeting divergent allosteric sites within highly conserved metabolic enzymes, a strategy that offers a pathway to develop highly selective inhibitors for targets previously deemed undruggable.",

    "text": "The rapid emergence and global dissemination of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have precipitated a public health crisis of unprecedented scale. While global vaccination efforts are critical for prevention, there remains an urgent and unmet need for effective antiviral therapeutics to treat active infections and mitigate disease severity. In the race to identify treatments, the scientific community has relied heavily on drug repurposing—screening existing pharmaceutical compounds with established safety profiles for activity against this novel pathogen. This strategy aims to bypass the lengthy timelines associated with de novo drug discovery, potentially offering immediate therapeutic options.\n\nAmong the leading candidates for repurposing is favipiravir (T-705), a pyrazinecarboxamide derivative. Favipiravir functions as a prodrug; it is metabolically activated intracellularly into its ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate (RTP) form, which acts as a nucleotide analog. This active metabolite targets the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), inhibiting viral replication. Favipiravir was originally approved in Japan for the stockpile against novel or re-emerging influenza pandemic strains and has demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a range of RNA viruses, including Ebola and Lassa fever viruses. Its unique mechanism of action—often attributed to a combination of chain termination and lethal mutagenesis—makes it a compelling subject for investigation against coronaviruses.\n\nDespite the initiation of numerous clinical trials evaluating favipiravir for COVID-19, the supporting pre-clinical evidence remains fragmented. While in vitro studies have confirmed that favipiravir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, reported half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) are relatively high, raising questions about the feasibility of achieving therapeutic levels in vivo. Furthermore, the translation of in vitro potency to clinical efficacy is heavily dependent on pharmacokinetics (PK) and tissue distribution, particularly within the respiratory tract. Crucially, the relationship between dosing regimens, plasma exposure, and potential toxicity in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been fully characterized in animal models. Without robust in vivo data, selecting appropriate dosing strategies for human trials remains a challenge, risking either sub-therapeutic dosing or drug-induced adverse events.\n\nTo bridge the gap between in vitro findings and clinical application, a physiologically relevant animal model is essential. The Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has emerged as a gold-standard small animal model for SARS-CoV-2. Hamsters support high levels of viral replication in the respiratory tract and develop clinical and pathological features, such as broncho-interstitial pneumonia, that closely mimic moderate-to-severe human COVID-19. This model provides an ideal platform for the rigorous evaluation of antiviral candidates.\n\nIn the present study, we utilized the Syrian hamster model to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the antiviral efficacy of favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated multiple dosing regimens, administering the drug both preventively and preemptively, to determine its effect on viral titers, clinical signs, and lung pathology. Parallel to efficacy testing, we performed a detailed pharmacokinetic analysis to define the plasma and tissue exposure profiles associated with antiviral activity and toxicity. Finally, to elucidate the mechanism of action in vivo, we analyzed viral genomes from treated animals for signatures of lethal mutagenesis. Our findings provide critical insights into the therapeutic window of favipiravir and the pharmacological parameters necessary to guide its safe and effective use in humans.",

    "text": "In the face of the ongoing global pandemic, the rapid identification of effective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 is paramount. In this study, we utilized a Syrian hamster model to evaluate the in vivo antiviral efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of favipiravir. Our results demonstrate that favipiravir exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in a dose-dependent manner, primarily driving viral clearance through a mechanism of lethal mutagenesis. However, our data also highlight a narrow therapeutic index, as the high doses required for optimal antiviral efficacy were associated with signs of toxicity in the animal model.\n\nThe hamster model recapitulates key features of COVID-19, including high viral replication in the respiratory tract and pathological lung damage. Using this model, we observed that preemptive and preventive administration of favipiravir significantly reduced infectious viral titers in the lungs and alleviated clinical symptoms. Notably, the antiviral effect was most pronounced when the viral inoculum was lower, or when treatment was initiated preventively. For instance, undetectable infectious titers were achieved in animals treated with the highest dose (75 mg/day TID) in the preventive setting. This suggests that favipiravir may be most effective when administered early in the course of infection or as a prophylactic measure, consistent with the general principles of antiviral therapy for acute respiratory viral infections.\n\nA critical finding of this study is the confirmation of favipiravir’s mechanism of action in vivo. While viral RNA yields were reduced in treated animals, the reduction in infectious titers was significantly more profound. This discrepancy implies that the drug induces the production of non-infectious viral particles. Deep sequencing analysis supported this hypothesis, revealing a significant increase in the frequency of mutations, particularly G→A and C→U transitions, in the viral genomes recovered from treated animals. We found a significant negative association between infectious titers and the frequency of non-synonymous mutations. These data align with the known mechanism of favipiravir as a nucleotide analog that acts as a pseudo-substrate for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, forcing the virus into an \"error catastrophe\" or lethal mutagenesis.\n\nDespite these promising efficacy signals, the pharmacokinetic and safety profile observed in our study warrants careful consideration for human translation. We observed non-linear pharmacokinetics, where increasing doses led to disproportionately higher plasma concentrations. While high doses (75 mg/day TID) successfully mitigated lung pathology and viral replication, they were also associated with significant toxicity, manifested as weight loss in both infected and uninfected animals. Lower doses (37.5 mg/day TID) showed a better safety profile but reduced efficacy against high viral inocula.\n\nFurthermore, our tissue distribution analysis revealed that favipiravir concentrations in the lung—the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection—were approximately 1.6 to 2.7-fold lower than those in plasma. This restricted lung penetration underscores the necessity of maintaining high plasma concentrations to achieve therapeutic levels in the respiratory tract, potentially pushing the dosage into the toxic range observed in our study.\n\nIt is encouraging to note that the antiviral efficacy in our hamster model was achieved with plasma drug exposures comparable to those previously found during human clinical trials. However, the toxicity observed at the highest effective dose in hamsters highlights the importance of rigorous dose-finding studies in humans. The accumulation ratio observed after multiple doses suggests that careful dosing regimens will be required to balance antiviral potency with patient safety.\n\nIn conclusion, favipiravir demonstrates significant potential as a repurposed antiviral for COVID-19, capable of reducing viral infectivity and preventing lung pathology through lethal mutagenesis. However, the therapeutic window appears narrow. The dichotomy between the high doses required for robust viral clearance and the associated toxicity in this model suggests that while favipiravir is a promising candidate, its clinical application requires optimized dosing strategies to ensure safety without compromising efficacy. Future studies should focus on refining these regimens and exploring combination therapies that might allow for lower, safer doses of favipiravir.",

    "text": "The human brain relies on the sustained function of neurons, cells that are distinct among somatic tissues for their extreme longevity and postmitotic state. Unlike the rapidly turning over cells of the skin or intestinal lining, neurons must maintain their functional identity and structural integrity for the entire lifespan of the organism—often spanning decades. This longevity presents a unique biological challenge: the preservation of genome fidelity in the absence of DNA replication. While dividing cells can utilize homologous recombination during replication to faithfully repair DNA lesions or eliminate damaged cells through apoptosis and replacement, neurons have a limited capacity for self-renewal and a restricted repertoire of DNA repair mechanisms. Consequently, the maintenance of genome integrity in neurons is paramount to preventing cellular dysfunction, senescence, and death.\n\nDespite the critical need for genome stability, DNA damage accumulates in the brain with age and is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Neurons are continuously exposed to endogenous sources of genotoxic stress, such as reactive oxygen species generated by high metabolic activity, as well as transcriptional stress. Over time, the efficiency of DNA repair pathways—including nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER), and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)—declines. This age-associated erosion of repair capacity is thought to underlie the accumulation of somatic mutations and persistent DNA lesions observed in the aging brain. However, the precise distribution of these repair events across the neuronal genome remains poorly understood.\n\nHistorically, our understanding of neuronal DNA repair has been shaped by the concept of \"transcription-coupled repair\" (TCR), which posits that repair machinery is preferentially recruited to active genes to ensure the unhindered elongation of RNA polymerase. While TCR is undoubtedly a critical component of neuronal genome maintenance, it is unclear whether neurons possess a broader strategy to prioritize specific genomic regions beyond simply those that are highly transcribed. Do neurons randomly repair damage as it arises, or have they evolved a hierarchical system to protect essential genetic elements? Addressing this question has been hindered by a lack of methodologies capable of mapping successful DNA repair events genome-wide. Existing techniques often focus on mapping sites of DNA damage (e.g., double-strand breaks or γH2AX accumulation) rather than the sites where repair synthesis actually occurs.\n\nTo bridge this gap and define the landscape of genome maintenance in the human nervous system, we developed a targeted sequencing approach, termed \"Repair-seq.\" This method exploits the non-replicative nature of postmitotic neurons to map sites of unscheduled DNA synthesis. By introducing the nucleoside analog 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU)—typically used to label replicating cells—into postmitotic human embryonic stem cell-induced neurons (ESC-iNs), we were able to capture and sequence genomic regions undergoing DNA repair synthesis. Because these cells do not undergo S-phase DNA replication, significant EdU incorporation serves as a specific marker for DNA repair patches.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate that DNA repair in human neurons is not uniformly distributed nor solely dictated by transcriptional activity. Instead, we identify discrete \"DNA repair hotspots\" (DRHs) that cover approximately 1.6% of the genome. We show that these hotspots are enriched at promoters and conserved elements, protecting genes essential for neuronal identity and function. Furthermore, we characterize the proteomic landscape of these repair sites, revealing associations with specific histone variants and RNA-binding proteins implicated in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we provide evidence linking these repair hotspots to evolutionary conservation and epigenetic aging, suggesting that the selective protection of these genomic sites is a fundamental strategy for maintaining neuronal longevity. These findings offer a new framework for understanding how the neuronal genome is organized to resist the ravages of time and how failures in this organization may drive the aging process and disease.",

    "text": "In this study, we present a comprehensive map of genome-wide DNA repair events in postmitotic human neurons, generated using a novel sequencing approach, Repair-seq. By capturing the incorporation of the nucleoside analog EdU in non-replicating cells, we have defined a landscape of genomic maintenance that is far from random. Our findings reveal that human neurons employ a strategy of genomic prioritization, concentrating DNA repair machinery at distinct \"hotspots\" (DRHs) that cover approximately 1.6% of the genome. These sites are not merely widely transcribed regions but are specifically enriched at promoters and conserved elements associated with genes essential for neuronal identity and function. This suggests that the neuron, faced with the challenge of maintaining genomic fidelity over a human lifespan without the ability to replicate, has evolved a mechanism to preferentially protect the \"crown jewels\" of its genome—the sequences most critical for its survival and specific functional role.\n\nThe prevailing view of DNA repair in postmitotic cells has largely focused on transcription-coupled repair (TC-NER), where repair is directed to active genes to prevent transcriptional arrest. While our data confirm that global repair levels generally track with transcription, the specific biology of DRHs adds a layer of complexity to this model. We observed that DRHs are not strictly correlated with expression levels; rather, they are associated with genes fundamental to neuronal identity, regardless of their transcriptional output. This distinction is crucial. It implies that the neuron proactively safeguards the regulatory architecture required to maintain its cellular state, rather than simply reacting to damage in whatever genes happen to be active at the moment. The presence of DRHs in intergenic regions and their association with evolutionarily conserved elements (GERP scores) further supports the hypothesis that these hotspots represent a mechanism of evolutionary constraint, preserving genomic integrity in regions where mutations would be most deleterious.\n\nMechanistically, our proteomic analysis identifies a specific chromatin environment associated with these repair hotspots. The enrichment of histone H2A isoforms, particularly H2AZ, and RNA-binding proteins at these sites suggests that specific chromatin states may serve as beacons for repair machinery or facilitate the rapid recruitment of repair factors. The association with splicing factors is particularly intriguing given our finding that repair density paradoxically diminishes with gene length in DRHs. This may reflect the unique challenges of maintaining extremely long neuronal genes, where the coordination between transcription, splicing, and repair is necessary to prevent the formation of R-loops or other destabilizing structures. The fact that a significant subset of proteins identified at these repair sites are differentially expressed in Alzheimer’s disease highlights a direct molecular link between the failure of these specific repair mechanisms and neurodegeneration.\n\nOur results also offer a nuance to the relationship between neuronal activity and DNA damage. Previous studies in mice have linked neuronal stimulation to the generation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) at specific early-response genes. In contrast, our data in human ESC-iNs did not show a massive reorganization of repair hotspots upon acute KCl stimulation. However, the suppression of spontaneous activity via TTX treatment led to a reduction in DRHs. This suggests that in human neurons, basal neuronal activity is required to maintain the \"readiness\" of repair at these hotspots, but the system may be more robust or stable than murine models suggest. This species-specific difference underscores the importance of studying these pathways in a human context, particularly given the vastly different timescales of aging between humans and rodents.\n\nFinally, our findings provide a framework for understanding the \"epigenetic clock\" and the biological drivers of aging. The close spatial association between DRHs and CpG sites included in epigenetic aging models is striking. We propose that the accumulation of DNA damage and the subsequent stochastic redistribution of repair efforts—as modeled by our NCS experiments—contributes to the \"ticking\" of this clock. As neurons age, the capacity to maintain these focused hotspots may decline, or the machinery may be distracted by accumulating global damage. This loss of focus could lead to the erosion of the epigenetic landscape at essential genes, resulting in the loss of neuronal identity and function characteristic of aging and disease. By mapping these sites of preferential repair, we have identified potentially vulnerable loci that, when compromised, may drive the etiology of age-related neurocognitive decline. Future therapeutic strategies might focus not just on boosting global repair, but on restoring the precision of this genomic maintenance system to protect the loci most critical for neuronal health.",

    "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major public health challenge, ranking among the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. While the implementation of screening programs, such as colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical testing, has contributed to a decline in incidence and mortality rates in screened populations, participation rates often remain suboptimal due to the invasive nature of endoscopic procedures or the unpleasantness associated with stool-based tests. Consequently, there is a pressing need for non-invasive, blood-based biomarkers that can accurately identify individuals at high risk who would benefit most from targeted screening strategies.\n\nRisk stratification is a pivotal component of personalized cancer screening. Currently, risk prediction models often rely on Environmental Risk Scores (ERS), which aggregate lifestyle and clinical factors, and Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS), which sum the effects of common genetic variants identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). While these scores have provided valuable insights into disease susceptibility, their individual discriminative ability in the general population has historically been modest. The limited accuracy of these conventional models suggests that they may not capture the complex, dynamic biological changes occurring during the early phases of carcinogenesis, necessitating the exploration of novel biomarkers that reflect active disease processes.\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs)—small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally—have emerged as promising candidates for this purpose. Circulating miRNAs are highly stable in blood and have been shown to be dysregulated in various malignancies, including CRC. Their expression profiles often reflect tumor-specific changes and the host's systemic response to developing neoplasia. However, the majority of research to date has employed cross-sectional designs, comparing healthy controls to patients with established, clinically diagnosed cancer. While useful for diagnostic purposes, these studies do not necessarily evaluate the predictive value of miRNAs for future cancer occurrence. There is a paucity of longitudinal data assessing whether circulating miRNA profiles are altered in the pre-diagnostic window, years before the clinical manifestation of the disease.\n\nIn this study, we aimed to bridge this knowledge gap by deriving and validating a blood-based miRNA risk score for the prediction of CRC occurrence. Using a two-step design, we first identified candidate miRNAs through next-generation sequencing in a discovery set and subsequently evaluated their predictive performance in a large, independent prospective cohort with a 14-year follow-up. Uniquely, this study utilizes serum samples collected at baseline from healthy participants who subsequently developed CRC, allowing for the assessment of biomarkers in truly pre-diagnostic samples. Furthermore, taking advantage of the comprehensive phenotype and genotype data available for this cohort, we performed a head-to-head comparison of the predictive performance of our novel miRNA panel against established ERS and PRS models, as well as their combinations.",

    "text": "In this study, we derived and validated a 7-miRNA blood-based signature capable of predicting colorectal cancer (CRC) occurrence in a population-based cohort of older adults. The derived miRNA score demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with an optimism-corrected AUC of approximately 0.80. A key finding of this investigation is that the miRNA score significantly outperformed both a polygenic risk score (PRS) based on 140 established susceptibility loci and a comprehensive environmental risk score (ERS). Furthermore, the addition of the PRS or ERS to the miRNA model resulted in only marginal improvements in predictive performance. These results suggest that circulating miRNA profiles may capture dynamic, host-response, or early tumor-derived signals that offer superior risk stratification utility compared to static genetic or environmental risk factors alone.\n\nTo date, the majority of studies investigating circulating miRNAs in CRC have relied on diagnostic samples collected from patients with established disease compared to healthy controls. While these studies have identified numerous dysregulated miRNAs, they are limited by the \"cause-versus-consequence\" dilemma; it remains unclear whether the observed profiles reflect early carcinogenic processes or the systemic burden of advanced tumor presence. Our study addresses this gap by utilizing pre-diagnostic serum samples collected up to 14 years prior to diagnosis. The stability of the score’s performance across long-term follow-up suggests that this signature does not merely detect late-stage disease but may identify individuals with a predisposition to or early presence of precursor lesions and occult malignancy. This aligns with recent findings by Wikberg et al., who observed altered plasma miRNA levels years before diagnosis, although our data suggest a more consistent predictive value extending beyond the immediate pre-diagnostic period.\n\nThe superior performance of the miRNA score compared to the ERS and PRS is notable. The ERS, while based on well-known risk factors such as smoking, BMI, and diet, showed limited discriminative ability in our cohort (AUC 0.557). Similarly, the PRS, despite being constructed from a broad array of SNPs identified in genome-wide association studies, yielded a modest AUC of 0.622. This discrepancy highlights the inherent limitations of using static germline genetics or self-reported lifestyle factors for individual risk prediction. Circulating miRNAs, conversely, may act as \"liquid biopsies\" that reflect real-time cellular pathophysiology, immune surveillance, and inflammatory states associated with early carcinogenesis. Consequently, a blood-based miRNA test could serve as a more effective, minimally invasive tool to enrich screening populations, guiding high-risk individuals toward colonoscopy while potentially sparing low-risk individuals from unnecessary invasive procedures.\n\nRegarding the specific miRNAs included in our panel, our findings largely corroborate previous literature, though with distinct variations likely attributable to the pre-diagnostic nature of our samples. The upregulation of let-7g-5p, miR-23a-3p, and miR-92a-3p is consistent with their known roles in oncogenesis and prior diagnostic studies. However, we observed a downregulation of miR-19a-3p and miR-21-5p, which contrasts with reports of their upregulation in established CRC. Specifically, miR-21 is one of the most frequently upregulated oncomiRs in solid tumors. Its downregulation in our pre-diagnostic samples could represent a stage-dependent phenomenon, potentially reflecting an early immune response or homeostatic attempt to suppress tumorigenesis before the tumor burden drives systemic upregulation. Similarly, the downregulation of miR-27a-3p observed here contrasts with findings by Vychytilova-Faltejskova et al. but aligns with those by Tan et al., underscoring the heterogeneity of miRNA expression across different study populations, normalization strategies, and disease stages.\n\nThe strengths of this study lie in its prospective, population-based design and the long duration of follow-up, which mitigates selection bias and reverse causation common in case-control designs. Additionally, the direct comparison with ERS and PRS within the same dataset provides a robust benchmark for evaluating the clinical utility of the miRNA panel.\n\nHowever, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, while the sample size was sufficient for score derivation and internal validation using bootstrap methods, the absolute number of incident cases limited our ability to perform extensive stratified analyses by tumor stage or anatomical location. Second, the lack of an external, independent validation cohort warrants caution; external validation is a requisite step before clinical implementation. Finally, technical variability in miRNA quantification and the lack of standardized normalization protocols remain challenges in the field, although our use of a rigorously selected normalizer panel attempts to mitigate this.\n\nIn conclusion, we identified a 7-miRNA serum signature that predicts CRC risk with high accuracy up to 14 years prior to diagnosis, significantly outperforming established genetic and environmental risk scores. These findings support the potential of circulating miRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers for CRC risk stratification. Future research should focus on external validation of this panel and evaluating its cost-effectiveness as a triage test in population-based screening programs.",

    "text": "The human $\\beta$-globin locus is a paradigmatic system for studying developmental gene regulation, characterized by the sequential expression of embryonic ($\\epsilon$), fetal ($\\gamma$), and adult ($\\beta$) globin genes. In humans, fetal hemoglobin (HbF, $\\alpha_2\\gamma_2$) is the predominant oxygen carrier during gestation but is silenced shortly after birth, replaced by adult hemoglobin (HbA, $\\alpha_2\\beta_2$). This \"fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switch\" is of profound clinical significance because elevated levels of HbF in adulthood can ameliorate the clinical severity of $\\beta$-hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease (SCD) and $\\beta$-thalassemia. Consequently, elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing $\\gamma$-globin silencing remains a central goal in hematology, offering the promise of targeted therapies that reactivate HbF production.\n\nThe transcriptional silencing of $\\gamma$-globin is a tightly orchestrated process involving distal enhancer elements, such as the Locus Control Region (LCR), and proximal promoter interactions mediated by specific transcription factors. Over the past decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and functional analyses have identified key repressors of $\\gamma$-globin expression, most notably BCL11A and LRF/ZBTB7A. These factors, often working in concert with the erythroid master regulator GATA1 and the NuRD complex, facilitate the reconfiguration of chromatin loops to favor adult $\\beta$-globin expression. Additionally, the transcription factor SOX6 has been established as a critical repressor that co-occupies the $\\beta$-globin cluster with BCL11A and GATA1, contributing to the silencing of $\\gamma$-globin in definitive erythroid cells. Despite these advances, the complete inventory of proteins constituting the repressive chromatin complex and the precise mechanisms by which they coordinate precise developmental silencing remain incompletely understood.\n\nNon-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein (NonO), also known as p54nrb, is a multifunctional DNA- and RNA-binding protein belonging to the DBHS (Drosophila behavior/human splicing) family. NonO is a core component of nuclear paraspeckles and has been implicated in diverse cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and DNA repair. While NonO is known to interact with various transcription factors to modulate gene expression, its specific role in erythropoiesis and globin gene regulation has not been defined. Previous studies have noted that NonO can co-localize with BCL11A in nuclear paraspeckles and associate with the NuRD complex, raising the intriguing possibility that NonO may participate in the regulatory network governing hemoglobin switching.\n\nIn this study, we aimed to identify novel partners of the known repressor SOX6 to further delineate the molecular machinery of $\\gamma$-globin silencing. Using mass spectrometry analysis of SOX6-interacting proteins, we identified NonO as a direct binding partner of SOX6 in human erythroid cells. We demonstrate that NonO functions as a potent transcriptional repressor of $\\gamma$-globin genes by directly binding to a conserved octamer motif in the proximal $\\gamma$-globin promoter. We further show that depletion of NonO significantly reactivates $\\gamma$-globin expression in human erythroid cell lines and primary human erythroid progenitors. Finally, using a humanized $\\beta$-globin yeast artificial chromosome ($\\beta$-YAC) mouse model, we provide in vivo evidence that NonO is essential for the developmental silencing of human $\\gamma$-globin and murine embryonic globins. These findings establish NonO as a novel component of the fetal globin repressor complex and a potential therapeutic target for hemoglobin disorders.",

    "text": "The reactivation of fetal hemoglobin (gamma-globin) remains a primary therapeutic goal for ameliorating the clinical severity of beta-hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. While significant progress has been made in characterizing major repressors such as BCL11A and LRF/ZBTB7A, the precise molecular orchestration of the \"fetal switch\" involves a complex network of factors that is not yet fully resolved. In this study, we identify NonO (p54nrb) as a novel and potent transcriptional repressor of gamma-globin gene expression that functions through direct promoter occupancy and physical interaction with SOX6.\n\nOur findings expand the current understanding of the gamma-globin repression complex. Previous studies utilizing CUT&RUN approaches established that BCL11A predominantly occupies distal motifs to exert long-range silencing effects. In contrast, we demonstrate that NonO exerts its repressive influence by binding directly to a conserved octamer motif (ATGCAAAT) located within the proximal promoter of the gamma-globin genes. This distinct localization suggests that NonO may function as a crucial anchor or cofactor at the promoter specifically, potentially stabilizing the repressive architecture initiated by distal regulators. This hypothesis is supported by our observation that the simultaneous knockdown of NonO and SOX6, or NonO and BCL11A, resulted in additive reactivation of gamma-globin expression, implying distinct, albeit cooperative, mechanisms of action.\n\nThe functional relationship between NonO and SOX6 identified here provides mechanistic insight into how SOX6 exerts its regulatory control. While SOX6 is established as a master regulator of erythroid maturation and globin silencing, its direct binding to the gamma-globin proximal promoter has been somewhat elusive, as canonical SOX6 motifs are absent in these regions. Our protein-interaction assays reveal that NonO physically interacts with the HMG box and Leucine zipper domains of SOX6. We propose a model wherein NonO may facilitate the recruitment or stabilization of SOX6 at the proximal promoter, or conversely, that NonO serves as a scaffold within the larger globin-switching complex. This interaction aligns with prior proteomic characterizations identifying NonO as a component of the NuRD complex, a known epigenetic silencer of fetal globin.\n\nThe evolutionary conservation of NonO function underscores its biological significance. Utilizing a humanized beta-YAC mouse model with conditional Mx1-Cre deletion, we demonstrated that NonO is essential for silencing both the human gamma-globin transgene and murine embryonic globins (epsilon y and beta h1) in vivo. The fact that NonO depletion reactivated embryonic globin expression in murine MEL cells and human gamma-globin in adult erythroblasts suggests that NonO targets a fundamental, conserved machinery of developmental gene silencing.\n\nClinically, the magnitude of gamma-globin induction observed upon NonO depletion is promising. In primary human erythroid progenitor cells, NonO knockdown increased gamma-globin mRNA to approximately 12% of total beta-like globin expression. This level of induction approaches the therapeutic threshold required to mitigate the pathological polymerization of sickle hemoglobin. However, the multifunctionality of NonO warrants cautious consideration regarding its potential as a therapeutic target. NonO is a pleiotropic protein involved in diverse nuclear processes, including mRNA splicing, DNA damage response, and paraspeckle formation. Indeed, we observed that NonO-deficient K562 cells exhibited cell cycle alterations, specifically a delay in the G2/M phase. While differentiation markers in primary erythroblasts remained largely unaffected, future therapeutic strategies would ideally need to disrupt the specific interface between NonO and the erythroid repression complex—perhaps targeting the NonO-SOX6 interaction surface—rather than ablating the protein entirely, to avoid off-target perturbations of essential nuclear functions.\n\nFinally, an intriguing observation in our luciferase assays utilizing the -175 T-to-C mutant promoter suggests context-dependent duality in NonO function. The unexpected increase in activity with this mutant suggests that alterations in the promoter landscape may convert NonO from a repressor to an activator, or alternatively, displace competing repressors such as GATA1/TAL1 complexes. Future structural and mechanistic studies will be required to fully disentangle these context-specific dynamics.\n\nIn summary, we establish NonO as a critical, evolutionarily conserved repressor of fetal hemoglobin. By delineating its direct binding to the proximal promoter and its cooperation with SOX6, we provide a more comprehensive map of the chromatin machinery governing the fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switch. These insights not only advance our fundamental understanding of erythroid developmental biology but also highlight the NonO-SOX6 axis as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in hemoglobinopathies.",

    "text": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has achieved remarkable clinical success in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. However, the translation of this efficacy to solid tumors remains a significant challenge. Unlike the permissive environment of lymphoid malignancies, solid tumors present a hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) characterized by physical barriers, metabolic restrictions, and a complex network of immunosuppressive cells. These factors contribute to poor CAR-T cell infiltration, rapid functional exhaustion, and limited persistence. Furthermore, solid tumors frequently exhibit antigen heterogeneity or undergo antigen loss under therapeutic pressure, leading to tumor escape and treatment failure. To overcome these barriers, strategies must not only enhance the autonomous function of CAR-T cells but also remodel the TME to recruit and sustain an endogenous anti-tumor immune response.\n\nOne promising approach to reverse immunosuppression and reinvigorate the TME is the delivery of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) agonists. Activation of intracellular viral sensors, such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), induces type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, which is critical for priming innate immunity and promoting adaptive T cell responses. However, the clinical utility of PRR agonists is currently limited by delivery challenges. Systemic administration often leads to toxicity or insufficient accumulation at the tumor site, while intratumoral injections suffer from limited distribution and an inability to precisely time immune activation with tumor cell death.\n\nCritically, the cellular target of PRR agonism dictates the therapeutic outcome. While activation of RIG-I/MDA5 in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) promotes cross-priming and anti-tumor immunity, we and others have shown that activation of these same pathways in cancer cells can be detrimental. In the absence of a robust adaptive immune response, RIG-I signaling in tumor cells can drive an IFN-I signature that paradoxically supports tumor growth, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Therefore, a delivery strategy that preferentially targets PRR agonists to immune cells while sparing cancer cells is required to maximize therapeutic efficacy and minimize deleterious off-target effects.\n\nHere, we propose a strategy to utilize the CAR-T cell not merely as a cytotoxic effector, but as a smart delivery vehicle for immunostimulatory cargo. We engineered CAR-T cells to express RN7SL1, an endogenous non-coding RNA that, when unshielded, serves as a potent agonist for both RIG-I and MDA5. Unlike synthetic analogs, RN7SL1 is naturally packaged into extracellular vesicles (EVs). We hypothesized that CAR-T cells could deploy RN7SL1-loaded EVs to selectively activate endogenous innate immune cells in the TME.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate that RN7SL1-armored CAR-T cells exhibit enhanced autonomous expansion and effector-memory differentiation. Furthermore, we show that these CAR-T cells selectively transfer RN7SL1 to endogenous myeloid cells and dendritic cells (DCs) via EVs, sparing tumor cells. This targeted delivery remodels the TME by restricting the development of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), reducing transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-$\\beta$) signaling, and promoting the differentiation of costimulatory DC subsets. Consequently, this orchestrates a potent endogenous immune response capable of rejecting solid tumors, even in the context of CAR antigen loss. Finally, we leverage this platform to co-deliver peptide antigens, demonstrating that CAR-T cells can serve as \"cellular vaccines\" to direct the endogenous immune system against tumors lacking adequate neoantigens.",

    "text": "The clinical success of CAR-T cell therapy in hematologic malignancies has not yet been replicated in solid tumors, where efficacy is restricted by poor infiltration, T cell exhaustion, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, even when initial responses occur, antigen heterogeneity allows for the outgrowth of tumor variants that have lost CAR-targeted antigens. In this study, we demonstrate that CAR-T cells engineered to deploy the endogenous immunostimulatory RNA, RN7SL1, function as a multi-armored platform that simultaneously addresses these barriers. By recoding the TME through the delivery of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) agonists, RN7SL1-CAR-T cells enhance their own autonomous persistence while orchestrating a potent endogenous immune response capable of rejecting tumors even in the context of antigen loss.\n\nA critical challenge in utilizing PRR agonists for cancer immunotherapy is the complexity of interferon (IFN) signaling. While PRR activation in immune cells primes adaptive immunity, RIG-I signaling within cancer cells can paradoxically drive tumor progression and resistance. Our data reveals that the therapeutic window for RN7SL1 relies on its preferential delivery to immune cells over cancer cells. Unlike soluble agonists or systemic delivery, RN7SL1 expressed by CAR-T cells is packaged into extracellular vesicles (EVs). Upon CAR engagement, these EVs are transferred with high selectivity to endogenous myeloid cells and dendritic cells (DCs) rather than the tumor itself. This directional transfer effectively decouples the beneficial immunostimulatory effects on the host immune system from the potentially deleterious effects of activating RIG-I in carcinoma cells.\n\nMechanistically, the delivery of RN7SL1 to the myeloid compartment results in a profound remodeling of the TME. We observed that RN7SL1 restricts the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and reduces TGFB signaling, factors known to impede immunotherapy. Concurrently, RN7SL1 promotes the differentiation of DCs toward a co-stimulatory phenotype (DC1), characterized by increased CD86 and decreased PDL1 expression. This innate reprogramming is dependent on host RIG-I/MAVS signaling and is essential for priming endogenous CD8+ T cells. Consequently, the TME shifts from an immunosuppressive state to one that supports the expansion of effector-memory T cells.\n\nBeyond its non-autonomous effects on the TME, RN7SL1 confers significant autonomous benefits to the CAR-T cells themselves. We found that RN7SL1 expression promotes an effector-memory differentiation state and reduces transcriptional signatures associated with exhaustion, such as TOX and TIGIT expression. This intrinsic enhancement leads to improved persistence and expansion in vivo, suggesting that RN7SL1 signaling acts in a cell-autonomous manner to sustain CAR-T cell fitness. This dual function—enhancing both the vehicle (CAR-T cell) and the environment (TME)—distinguishes this approach from strategies that rely solely on checkpoint blockade or cytokine armoring.\n\nPerhaps the most significant implication of our findings is the ability to overcome antigen escape. We show that the recruitment of endogenous T cells by RN7SL1 broadens the anti-tumor repertoire to include non-CAR tumor antigens, such as TRP2. This \"epitope spreading\" enables the eradication of heterogeneous tumors containing antigen-negative variants, a feat that standard CAR-T cells failed to achieve in our models. Moreover, for tumors with low mutational burdens lacking sufficient neoantigens, we demonstrated that CAR-T cells can be engineered to co-deliver peptide antigens alongside RN7SL1. This combination of adjuvant (RN7SL1) and antigen (peptide) creates a self-contained vaccination system within the tumor, driving rejection even in poorly immunogenic settings.\n\nWhile our study utilizes syngeneic mouse models to dissect the interplay between CAR-T cells and the endogenous immune system, future work must validate these mechanisms in humanized systems. Additionally, the range of cargo capable of being trafficked via CAR-T EVs warrants further exploration. In summary, we present a strategy that leverages the natural biology of RNA sensing to convert CAR-T cells into orchestrators of a systemic anti-tumor response. By delivering RN7SL1, we can effectively \"heat\" cold tumors, preventing the development of resistance and extending the efficacy of CAR-T therapy to solid malignancies.",

    "text": "Human mobility is a fundamental driver of societal dynamics, influencing economic exchange, urbanization, social cohesion, and the spatial spread of infectious diseases. In an increasingly interconnected world, quantifying how populations move is critical for a wide range of applications, from urban planning and infrastructure development to designing effective public health interventions and forecasting epidemic trajectories. The accurate estimation of travel patterns is particularly vital in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where rapid population growth, changing economic landscapes, and resource constraints necessitate precise data to inform policy and resource allocation. However, in many such settings, robust census data and comprehensive travel surveys are often outdated, infrequent, or entirely absent, creating a significant knowledge gap regarding the movements of large populations.\n\nTo bridge this gap, spatial interaction models have become indispensable tools for estimating human mobility flows when direct data are unavailable. Among these, the gravity model and the radiation model are the most widely employed frameworks. The gravity model, inspired by Newton’s law of gravitation, postulates that the flow of individuals between two locations is proportional to their population sizes and inversely proportional to the distance between them. The radiation model, a parameter-free alternative, conceptualizes mobility as a diffusion process determined by the population distribution surrounding the origin and destination, rather than distance per se. These models have been successfully applied and validated extensively in high-income nations, particularly within dense urban environments where transportation networks are well-developed and mobility behaviors are often regularized by commuting patterns.\n\nDespite their widespread use, the applicability of these standard models to the rural and distinctively heterogeneous landscapes of sub-Saharan Africa remains under-investigated. Mobility in these settings is shaped by a complex interplay of factors that differ markedly from the industrialized contexts where these models were originally conceived. Geographic barriers, sparse road infrastructure, seasonal economic activities, and varying degrees of urbanization create unique mobility signatures. For instance, travel in rural areas may be driven less by daily commuting and more by seasonal agriculture, social visits, or access to distant markets and healthcare, potentially violating the standard distance-decay assumptions of traditional gravity models. Furthermore, the \"friction\" of distance in regions with unpaved roads or limited public transport is likely distinct from that in regions with high-speed connectivity. Consequently, applying \"off-the-shelf\" models without rigorous validation or adaptation to local contexts runs the risk of generating biased estimates, which could, in turn, lead to flawed policy decisions—such as misidentifying high-risk corridors for disease importation or misallocating transportation investments.\n\nThe increasing availability of mobile phone call detail records (CDRs) offers a novel opportunity to scrutinize and refine these modeling approaches. As mobile phone penetration surges across sub-Saharan Africa, anonymized CDRs provide a high-resolution, privacy-preserving proxy for human movement on a national scale. These datasets allow researchers to observe actual travel patterns between administrative regions, providing a ground truth against which theoretical models can be tested. While CDRs themselves have limitations, including coverage biases and lack of demographic detail, they represent the best available empirical evidence for validating spatial interaction models in data-scarce regions.\n\nIn this study, we characterize human mobility patterns in rural settings of sub-Saharan Africa and systematically evaluate the performance of spatial interaction models in estimating these flows. We analyzed mobility networks inferred from mobile phone data in four distinct countries: Namibia, Kenya, Burkina Faso, and Zambia. These nations were selected to represent a diversity of geographic sizes, population densities, and degrees of urbanization, ranging from the sparse, arid landscapes of Namibia to the more densely populated regions of Kenya. Our primary objective was to investigate whether standard gravity and radiation models adequately capture the observed mobility patterns or if context-specific adaptations are required. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that adjusting gravity models to account for trip heterogeneity—specifically by fitting distinct parameters for travel between rural and urban areas (urbanicity) and for travel within versus between administrative regions—would significantly improve model fidelity.\n\nBy developing and comparing a suite of model variants, we aim to identify the structural features of mobility that are most critical for accurate estimation in sub-Saharan African contexts. This analysis seeks not only to validate existing theoretical frameworks but also to provide practical guidance for researchers and policymakers who must rely on modeled estimates in the absence of empirical data. Understanding which model variations perform best in specific demographic and geographic conditions will enhance our ability to predict human movement, ultimately supporting more effective responses to public health crises and development challenges in the region.",

    "text": "Characterizing human mobility patterns is essential for a wide array of public health and planning applications, from forecasting infectious disease transmission to designing disaster relief strategies. While spatial interaction models have been extensively validated in high-income nations, their application in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)—particularly within rural settings—has remained less rigorous. In this study, we addressed this gap by evaluating mobility patterns in Namibia, Kenya, Burkina Faso, and Zambia using mobile phone data. We demonstrated that standard gravity models frequently fail to capture the heterogeneity of travel in these diverse settings, particularly overestimating movement in rural areas. However, we found that increasing model complexity to account for regional boundaries and urbanicity consistently improved model fit, providing a more accurate framework for estimating mobility in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe limitations of the basic gravity model in these contexts were evident in its inability to replicate the observed distributions of trip frequencies. Specifically, the basic model tended to overestimate trip counts between predominantly rural locations across all four countries. This aligns with previous observations that standard gravity models, while effective for predicting inter-city commuter movement in high-income settings, struggle with the demographic heterogeneity and lower population densities often found in rural LMIC contexts. By introducing flexibility into the model to parameterize trips based on urbanicity and regionality, we were able to correct for these biases. The regional-urbanicity model, which fitted unique parameters for origin and destination population sizes and distance based on trip type, emerged as the most robust approach, reducing the deviance information criterion (DIC) by 16% to 41% across the studied countries. This suggests that the drivers of mobility—and the friction of distance—are not uniform across these landscapes but are distinctively modulated by the socioeconomic and infrastructural characteristics of urban versus rural environments.\n\nOur findings also highlight the variability in the performance of radiation models. While the radiation model is often touted for its parameter-free nature, it yielded the poorest performance in Namibia, Burkina Faso, and Zambia. Conversely, it outperformed the basic gravity model in Kenya. We hypothesize that this discrepancy is driven by differences in population distribution; Kenya exhibits a distinct population structure compared to the more heterogeneous distributions found in the other three countries. This reinforces the notion that no single spatial interaction model is universally applicable across all LMICs. Rather, the choice of model must be informed by the specific demographic and spatial structure of the population in question.\n\nFurthermore, our analysis reveals that the \"best\" model implies a trade-off between complexity and specific predictive accuracy. While the regional-urbanicity model provided the best overall fit, simpler models occasionally produced more accurate absolute trip estimates for specific trip categories. For instance, in Namibia, a model accounting solely for region was sufficient to best capture rural-to-rural and inter-regional travel. Similarly, in Zambia, the regional model frequently produced the most accurate estimates for a range of trip types. This nuance is critical for researchers to consider: if the goal is to model general connectivity, the complex regional-urbanicity model is superior; however, for specific inquiries—such as monitoring local rural spread of a pathogen—simpler, computationally less intensive models may suffice or even excel.\n\nThe implications of these findings extend beyond theoretical geography into practical public health and policy implementation. Mobility data are often proxies for contact patterns in epidemiological modeling. The systematic overestimation of rural travel by basic models could lead to inflated predictions of disease spread speed in rural areas, potentially misguiding resource allocation. By utilizing the adjusted models presented here, researchers can generate more realistic mobility matrices even when direct data are limited or unavailable.\n\nIn conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive evaluation of spatial interaction models against large-scale mobility data from multiple Sub-Saharan African countries. We show that accounting for urbanicity and regional heterogeneity is not merely a statistical refinement but a necessary adjustment to reflect the reality of human movement in these settings. These insights offer clear guidance for selecting and calibrating models to estimate migratory flows and disease dynamics, ultimately improving the efficacy of interventions in resource-constrained environments.",

    "text": "Genomic integrity is essential for cell survival and the suppression of tumorigenesis. Among the myriad pathways evolved to protect the genome, Homologous Recombination (HR) plays a pivotal role in the error-free repair of toxic DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs). A central player in this pathway is the tumor suppressor protein BRCA2, mutations in which are strongly associated with a predisposition to breast, ovarian, and other cancers (Roy et al., 2011). BRCA2 functions primarily as a mediator of HR by facilitating the loading of the recombinase RAD51 onto resected single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), thereby displacing replication protein A (RPA) and promoting the formation of the nucleoprotein filaments required for strand invasion and homology search (Jensen et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010). Consequently, the precise regulation of BRCA2 activity is critical; its deregulation can lead to genomic instability, accumulation of chromosomal aberrations, and oncogenic transformation.\n\nThe DNA Damage Response (DDR) is a tightly coordinated signaling network that orchestrates DNA repair. Upon the induction of DSBs, the apical kinases ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) and ATR (Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related) are activated to phosphorylate a vast network of substrates, initiating cell cycle checkpoints and recruiting repair factors to sites of damage (Matsuoka et al., 2007). While the roles of these kinases in promoting HR and regulating BRCA2 are well-documented, the mechanisms balancing these phosphorylation events remain less characterized. Reversible protein phosphorylation is a fundamental regulatory mechanism, implying that protein phosphatases must play equally critical, yet distinct, roles in tuning the DDR (Palacios et al., 2011). However, compared to the extensive characterization of DNA damage kinases, the specific phosphatases that regulate BRCA2 and the mechanics of their recruitment to sites of damage are not fully understood.\n\nProtein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major serine/threonine phosphatase implicated in a wide array of cellular processes, including cell growth, signaling, and apoptosis. The specificity and localization of PP2A are largely dictated by its regulatory B subunits. Specifically, the B56 family of regulatory subunits (isoforms $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $\\delta$, and $\\epsilon$) directs the trimeric PP2A complex to specific substrates containing a conserved LxxIxE short linear motif (Hertz et al., 2016). Recent studies have highlighted the importance of PP2A-B56 in maintaining chromosomal stability during mitosis, but its direct involvement in HR-mediated DNA repair remains to be fully elucidated.\n\nWe previously identified a putative, highly conserved LxxIxE binding motif for PP2A-B56 within an uncharacterized region of BRCA2, situated between the BRC1 and BRC2 repeats. The evolutionary conservation of this motif suggests it supports a critical biological function, yet the physiological relevance of a direct BRCA2-PP2A interaction has remained unknown. In this study, we delineate a regulatory pathway linking DNA damage signaling to phosphatase recruitment. We demonstrate that ATM and ATR kinases phosphorylate a conserved region of BRCA2 in response to DSBs, and that these phosphorylation events are a prerequisite for the binding of PP2A-B56. Furthermore, we show that this interaction is indispensable for efficient RAD51 filament formation and HR activity. Finally, we provide evidence that cancer-associated mutations within this regulatory interface disrupt the BRCA2-PP2A-B56 interaction, sensitizing cells to Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, thus highlighting the clinical significance of this novel regulatory axis.",

    "text": "In this study, we elucidate a critical regulatory mechanism governing the function of BRCA2 in Homologous Recombination (HR). While the structural role of BRCA2 in nucleating RAD51 filaments is well-established, the signaling cascades that modulate this activity in space and time have remained less clear. Here, we identify the protein phosphatase PP2A-B56 as an essential binding partner of BRCA2 and demonstrate that this interaction is strictly required for efficient RAD51 filament formation and genomic integrity.\n\nOur data reveals that the recruitment of PP2A-B56 to BRCA2 is not constitutive but is dynamically regulated by the DNA damage response (DDR). We delineate a pathway wherein the detection of double-strand breaks (DSBs) triggers ATM and ATR kinases to phosphorylate a highly conserved region of BRCA2. These phosphorylation events function as a molecular switch, significantly increasing the affinity of BRCA2 for the B56 regulatory subunit. This finding aligns with emerging paradigms where kinase signaling creates docking sites for phosphatases, thereby establishing localized \"dephosphorylation zones\" at sites of DNA damage. The conservation of the LxxIxE motif and its flanking phosphorylation sites over 450 million years of evolution underscores the fundamental importance of this regulatory node in vertebrate genome maintenance.\n\nA key finding of this work is the absolute requirement of the BRCA2-PP2A-B56 complex for the formation of RAD51 foci. Disruption of this interaction, either through mutation of the LxxIxE motif (2A) or the flanking phospho-sites (3AQ), results in a failure to assemble RAD51 filaments, despite the fact that BRCA2's intrinsic ability to bind RAD51 remains intact. This suggests that the recruitment of phosphatase activity is distinct from, yet cooperative with, the chaperone activity of BRCA2. While the specific substrates of BRCA2-associated PP2A-B56 remain to be fully characterized, it is plausible that localized dephosphorylation of RAD51, BRCA2 itself, or other components of the recombination machinery is necessary to stabilize the nucleoprotein filament or facilitate strand invasion.\n\nClinically, our findings provide new structural and functional insights into BRCA2 Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS). We demonstrate that missense mutations located within this regulatory module—such as S1106R, T1116P, and T1128I—can deregulate the BRCA2-B56 interaction. Notably, these perturbations are bidirectional; mutations can either impair binding (T1128I) or aberrantly enhance it (S1106R, T1116P). Regardless of the direction of deregulation, these variants resulted in compromised DNA damage tolerance and increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. This highlights the necessity for precise regulation of the BRCA2-phosphatase interaction; both hypo- and hyper-binding compromise HR efficiency. Consequently, this conserved region represents a functional hotspot that warrants careful consideration in genetic counseling and the classification of BRCA2 variants.\n\nIn summary, we identify PP2A-B56 as a positive regulator of BRCA2-mediated DNA repair. By coupling kinase sensing (ATM/ATR) to phosphatase recruitment, the cell ensures that HR machinery is not only recruited to breaks but is also functionally activated in a damage-dependent manner. These results broaden our understanding of the DDR signaling landscape and suggest that the BRCA2-PP2A-B56 interface may serve as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target in BRCA2-mutated cancers.",

    "text": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, characterized by a highly aggressive phenotype and a profound resistance to conventional chemotherapies. The molecular landscape of PDAC is dominated by activating mutations in the KRAS oncogene, which are present in over 90% of cases [refs]. Oncogenic KRAS drives tumor maintenance and progression through the constitutive activation of downstream effector pathways, most notably the RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade [refs]. Consequently, the therapeutic targeting of KRAS and its effectors has been a longstanding priority in pancreatic cancer research. While recent advances have yielded direct inhibitors for specific KRAS alleles, such as G12C, the majority of PDAC patients harbor KRAS mutations that remain challenging to target directly [refs]. Therefore, inhibiting downstream effectors, particularly ERK1/2, represents a compelling therapeutic strategy.\n\nDespite the biological rationale for targeting the MAPK pathway, the clinical efficacy of single-agent ERK inhibitors (ERKi) has been limited by the rapid emergence of adaptive resistance mechanisms and dose-limiting toxicities in normal tissues [refs]. Cancer cells frequently bypass MAPK suppression through the activation of compensatory signaling feedback loops, such as the upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases or the activation of parallel survival pathways like autophagy [refs]. To overcome these hurdles and improve the therapeutic index of ERK inhibitors, there is a critical need to identify improved combination strategies that exploit specific vulnerabilities induced by oncogenic KRAS signaling.\n\nOne potential vulnerability in KRAS-driven cancers lies in their aberrant proliferation and metabolic stress, which can render them hypersensitive to disruptions in DNA damage repair (DDR) mechanisms. Oncogene-induced replication stress is a hallmark of PDAC, forcing tumor cells to rely heavily on cell cycle checkpoints to maintain genomic integrity [refs]. Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), a serine/threonine kinase activated by ATR in response to single-stranded DNA breaks and replication stress, plays a pivotal role in this defense mechanism [refs]. CHK1 coordinates cell cycle arrest and facilitates DNA repair via homologous recombination (HRR), preventing the accumulation of lethal DNA damage during S-phase [refs]. Given the elevated replication stress inherent to KRAS-mutant cells, we hypothesized that the ATR-CHK1 axis constitutes a critical dependency that, if disrupted, could sensitize PDAC cells to ERK inhibition.\n\nBeyond cell cycle regulation and DDR, KRAS-mutant PDAC cells exhibit distinct metabolic dependencies, including a reliance on autophagy—a lysosomal degradation pathway that recycles cellular components to sustain metabolism and survival under stress [refs]. We and others have previously demonstrated that ERK inhibition elicits a compensatory upregulation of autophagy, which protects cancer cells from the cytotoxic effects of MAPK suppression [refs]. Consequently, simultaneous inhibition of autophagy has emerged as a strategy to prevent resistance to MAPK-targeted therapies. However, the interplay between DDR signaling, MAPK pathways, and autophagy regulation remains incompletely understood, particularly in the context of therapeutic combinations.\n\nIn this study, we applied unbiased genetic loss-of-function screens to systematically delineate modulators of ERK inhibitor sensitivity in KRAS-mutant PDAC. We identified components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway as top hits, revealing that CHK1 is essential for the survival of KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer cells. We demonstrate that pharmacologic inhibition of CHK1 results in apoptotic growth suppression and a significant reduction in MYC expression. However, we also uncovered that CHK1 inhibition triggers compensatory activation of both ERK signaling and autophagy, providing a mechanistic rationale for resistance. By dissecting these adaptive responses, we identify RIF1—a key regulator of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)—as a critical node linking ERK signaling to DNA repair competence. We show that concurrent suppression of CHK1 and ERK, or CHK1 and autophagy, creates a synthetic lethal interaction that significantly enhances therapeutic efficacy. Ultimately, our findings suggest that a triple-combination strategy targeting CHK1, ERK, and autophagy may overcome the limitations of current monotherapies, offering a potent new approach for treating KRAS-mutant PDAC.",

    "text": "In this study, we addressed the critical clinical challenge of intrinsic and acquired resistance to MAPK pathway inhibition in KRAS mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Through unbiased genetic screens, we identified the cell cycle checkpoint kinase CHK1 as a distinct vulnerability in KRAS mutant cells and a potent modulator of sensitivity to ERK inhibitors (ERKi). Our findings elucidate a mechanistic interplay between oncogenic KRAS signaling and the DNA damage response (DDR), revealing that concurrent suppression of these pathways creates a synthetic lethal interaction driven by the collapse of DNA repair mechanisms and the blockade of compensatory survival signaling.\n\nThe reliance of KRAS mutant cancers on functional DDR machinery to manage replication stress is well documented, yet clinical efforts to target CHK1 in PDAC have historically yielded limited success. Our data provide a mechanistic rationale for these clinical failures and a roadmap for overcoming them. We demonstrate that while CHK1 inhibition (CHK1i) induces DNA damage and replication stress, PDAC cells rapidly deploy compensatory mechanisms to evade apoptosis, specifically the upregulation of ERK signaling and the activation of autophagy. The rebound in pERK following CHK1i treatment suggests that the MAPK pathway actively buffers the genotoxic stress induced by checkpoint abrogation. Consequently, the addition of an ERKi prevents this adaptive signaling, converting the cytostatic effect of single-agent therapy into a strongly apoptotic response.\n\nA central discovery of this work is the identification of the DNA repair factor RIF1 as a critical downstream effector linking ERK signaling to the DDR. We found that ERK activity is required to maintain RIF1 transcription and that ERK inhibition phenocopies RIF1 depletion. RIF1 promotes non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) by stabilizing 53BP1 at sites of DNA damage. Conversely, CHK1 is essential for homologous recombination repair (HRR). Therefore, the synergy observed between ERKi and CHK1i can be attributed to a dual blockade of DNA repair: ERKi suppresses NHEJ (via RIF1 loss) while CHK1i impairs HRR. This leaves the cancer cell without viable options to repair the double-strand breaks accumulated during replication stress, leading to catastrophe and cell death. This defining link between ERK and RIF1 highlights a previously underappreciated facet of how oncogenic signaling coordinates genome stability.\n\nBeyond DNA repair, our results highlight the metabolic plasticity of PDAC cells under therapeutic stress. We observed that CHK1 inhibition activates AMPK, likely in response to energy depletion or genotoxic stress, which subsequently drives an increase in autophagic flux. This aligns with previous reports identifying autophagy as a resistance mechanism to MAPK inhibition. By targeting this third arm of the resistance network with chloroquine (CQ), we achieved profound growth suppression. The triple combination of CHK1i, ERKi, and CQ resulted in the highest levels of apoptosis and synergistic growth inhibition in both cell lines and patient-derived organoids. Importantly, the relative lack of toxicity in non-transformed NIH 3T3 cells suggests a favorable therapeutic index for this regimen, exploiting the specific dependencies of the KRAS-driven tumor.\n\nWe also noted that CHK1i sensitivity correlates with the suppression of MYC. While ERK inhibition is known to destabilize MYC protein, we found that CHK1 inhibition reduces MYC predominantly at the transcriptional level. Interestingly, while MYC downregulation is a consistent feature of effective treatment, restoring MYC expression did not rescue cells from the lethality of the CHK1i/ERKi combination. This indicates that while MYC loss is a biomarker of pathway engagement, the primary driver of cytotoxicity in this context is the catastrophic failure of DNA repair mechanisms rather than the loss of MYC-dependent proliferation alone.\n\nFinally, our data suggest that inhibitors of ATR, the upstream activator of CHK1, may serve as viable alternatives in this combinatorial strategy. The ATR inhibitor ceralasertib showed comparable synergy when combined with ERKi or autophagy inhibitors. Given that CHK1 inhibitors have faced hurdles in clinical development, the availability of clinically advanced ATR inhibitors offers an immediate translational avenue for testing these combinations.\n\nIn conclusion, this study defines a distinct therapeutic strategy for KRAS mutant PDAC that integrates targeted inhibition of MAPK signaling, DNA damage checkpoints, and autophagy. By genetically and pharmacologically dissecting the crosstalk between these pathways, we show that CHK1 protects oncogenic KRAS-expressing cells from lethal DNA damage. Targeting CHK1—or its upstream kinase ATR—in conjunction with ERK and autophagy inhibition dismantles the redundant survival mechanisms that define pancreatic cancer, offering a promising combinatorial approach for clinical evaluation.",

    "text": "The development of the vertebrate body axis is a complex, orchestrating event that requires the precise coordination of cell proliferation, fate specification, and migration. While the formation of the anterior body is largely driven by gastrulation, the posterior extension of the body axis—specifically the tail—relies on the tail bud, a distinct population of undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells found at the posterior tip of the embryo. Within this dynamic niche, progenitor cells must make critical lineage decisions to differentiate into the axial mesoderm (notochord), paraxial mesoderm (somites), or the neural tube (Beck, 2015; Kimelman, 2016). The proper partition and segregation of these tissues are governed by a robust gene regulatory network, featuring key transcription factors such as brachyury (ntl), tbxt, and msgn1. Although studies in established model organisms like the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and mouse (Mus musculus) have elucidated many of the fundamental pathways driving these processes, questions remain regarding the precise mechanisms of cell sorting and the functional redundancies that ensure robustness in tail morphogenesis.\n\nA significant challenge in dissecting these genetic networks is the complexity of forward genetic screening in obligate outcrossing species. Traditional screening in vertebrates often requires multi-generational breeding schemes to isolate homozygous recessive mutations, a process that is both labor-intensive and space-consuming. Consequently, there is a demand for complementary vertebrate models that can streamline the identification of genetic regulators of development. The mangrove killifish, Kryptolebias marmoratus, offers a unique solution to these challenges. It is one of the only known vertebrates capable of self-fertilization, naturally producing highly inbred, isogenic strains (Tatarenkov et al., 2010). This reproductive strategy allows naturally occurring or chemically induced mutations to become homozygous within a single lineage without the need for complex crossing strategies. Furthermore, the genetic uniformity of isogenic strains significantly reduces background noise, facilitating the rapid identification of causative mutations through modern sequencing technologies.\n\nDespite its potential, K. marmoratus has remained an underutilized resource in developmental genetics. Previous limitations, such as the lack of genomic resources, have recently been overcome with the sequencing of its genome and the characterization of various isogenic lineages (Rhee et al., 2017). These advances now position the mangrove killifish as a powerful system for accelerating forward genetic screens. By leveraging the high homozygosity of this species, it is possible to bypass traditional genetic mapping and identify mutant alleles directly via comparative transcriptomics of pooled embryos.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate the utility of K. marmoratus as a model for developmental genetics by characterizing two N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutants affecting tail development: shorttail (stl) and balltail (btl). These mutants exhibit distinct phenotypic defects in the posterior notochord and muscle formation, respectively. Utilizing a rapid RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) approach on a highly isogenic background, we successfully identified the causative mutations in the notochord homeobox (noto) and mesogenin 1 (msgn1) genes. We further validated these findings using the medaka (Oryzias latipes) as a surrogate system for functional assays, confirming a conserved role for these genes in regulating cell sorting between the axial and paraxial mesoderm. Our findings not only clarify the reciprocal roles of noto and msgn1 in tail bud cell dynamics but also establish the mangrove killifish as a robust complementary model for future molecular genetic studies.",

    "text": "In this study, we established the self-fertilizing mangrove killifish, Kryptolebias marmoratus, as a robust model for rapid forward-genetic screening and molecular characterization of vertebrate development. By analyzing the shorttail (stl) and balltail (btl) mutants, we successfully identified point mutations in noto and msgn1, respectively, and elucidated their reciprocal roles in regulating cell fate decisions between axial and paraxial mesoderm during tail bud elongation.\n\nA primary challenge in vertebrate forward genetics is the time and space required to isolate mutants and map the responsible genomic loci. Our findings demonstrate that K. marmoratus offers significant advantages over traditional models like zebrafish or medaka due to its unique reproductive strategy. Because K. marmoratus are self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, recessive zygotic mutant phenotypes can be recovered in the F2 generation derived from a single F1 parent, effectively shortening the screening process by one generation. Furthermore, the highly inbred, isogenic nature of these strains results in extremely low polymorphism rates. This genomic uniformity allowed us to identify the causative mutations in noto and msgn1 using a single lane of RNA sequencing on a small pool of embryos, bypassing the labor-intensive need for reference genomes or traditional linkage mapping. This efficient workflow highlights the potential of K. marmoratus as a complementary system for rapid functional genomics.\n\nOur molecular analysis of the stl and btl mutants reveals essential mechanisms governing the bifurcation of mesodermal fate in the vertebrate tail. The stl phenotype, characterized by a shortened tail and loss of the posterior notochord, results from a mutation in noto. In these mutants, the expression of the notochord marker col9a1b was absent in the tail, and noto expression itself was suppressed. This aligns with conserved roles of noto in other vertebrates, where it is required for notochord specification. Our cell-tracing experiments in medaka morphants further clarified this mechanism: in the absence of functional Noto protein, tail bud cells failed to differentiate into the notochord and were instead misallocated to the paraxial region. This suggests that noto is necessary to retain cells in the midline and commit them to the axial fate.\n\nConversely, the btl mutant, driven by a loss-of-function mutation in msgn1, exhibited defects in paraxial mesoderm formation, evidenced by the reduction of somite markers hsp90aa and tbx6. The phenotypic \"ball\" shape observed in btl mutants appears to result from a failure of cell migration; rather than moving laterally to form somites, cells accumulated at the tail tip. This was confirmed in msgn1 medaka morphants, where labeled tail bud cells gathered in the midline and failed to migrate to the paraxial domains. These data indicate that msgn1 is critical for driving the movement of mesodermal progenitors out of the tail bud and into the presomitic mesoderm.\n\nThe distinct phenotypes and expression profiles of stl and btl mutants suggest a reciprocal interaction between noto and msgn1 that is essential for maintaining the balance between axial and paraxial tissues. In noto mutants, we observed a reduction in msgn1 expression, while in msgn1 mutants, noto expression was upregulated and ectopic. This suggests a regulatory loop where these factors may repress each other's domains to sharpen the boundary between the notochord and somites.\n\nThe double knockdown of noto and msgn1 in medaka resulted in a severe failure of cell deposition into either tissue type, leading to a ball-shaped tail similar to the msgn1 morphant but with compounded defects. Collectively, our results support a model where noto secures the axial identity and msgn1 promotes paraxial migration and differentiation. The precise spatiotemporal coordination of these two genes is required to convert the distinct population of tail bud progenitors into a properly elongated embryonic axis containing a defined notochord and segmented somites.\n\nIn summary, this study validates the mangrove killifish as a powerful, accelerated model for vertebrate genetics and uncovers the crucial interplay between noto and msgn1 in tail development. By identifying these conserved mechanisms, we provide insight into the evolutionary diversification of gene function and the redundancy required to establish tissue architecture during embryogenesis. Future studies utilizing this efficient screening platform will likely yield further insights into the genetic networks underlying vertebrate organogenesis.",

    "text": "Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by the kinetoplastid protozoan Trypanosoma brucei. Following transmission by the tsetse fly, bloodstream-form (BSF) parasites proliferate extracellularly in blood and lymph before invading the central nervous system (CNS), where infection is uniformly fatal if untreated. Although reported case numbers have declined over the past two decades, HAT remains a paradigmatic neglected tropical disease: it affects some of the world’s poorest populations, the clinical course is protracted and debilitating, and the therapeutic arsenal is fragile, toxic, and logistically demanding. Existing treatments for early-stage disease, such as pentamidine and suramin, require parenteral administration and are associated with significant adverse effects, while regimens effective against late-stage CNS disease, such as melarsoprol or nifurtimox–eflornithine combination therapy, are complex, prolonged, and difficult to deliver in resource-limited settings. The recent introduction of oral fexinidazole has improved the outlook for some patients, but concerns remain about spectrum of activity, stage-specific efficacy, and the long-term risk of emergent drug resistance. There is therefore a continuing need for new trypanocidal agents with novel mechanisms of action, simplified dosing, and activity against both peripheral and CNS-resident parasites.\n\nA distinctive feature of BSF T. brucei biology is its extreme dependence on glycolysis for ATP production. In the mammalian bloodstream, parasites rely almost entirely on the catabolism of host glucose, with the upper half of the glycolytic pathway compartmentalised within glycosomes, specialized peroxisome-related organelles. Oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrion is either absent or contributes negligibly to ATP generation in this life-cycle stage, rendering flux through glycolysis essential for parasite survival. Genetic and biochemical studies have identified several glycolytic enzymes as critical nodes, and phosphofructokinase (PFK) – which catalyses the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate – is a particularly attractive point of control. However, despite the centrality of glycolysis to trypanosome energy metabolism, the pathway has historically been regarded as a poor source of drug targets. Active sites are highly conserved across eukaryotes, substrates and intermediates are strongly polar and phosphorylated, and there has been a widespread assumption that achieving species selectivity without unacceptable host toxicity would be difficult.\n\nOne way to circumvent this problem is to exploit allosteric regulation rather than compete directly with substrates at conserved catalytic sites. Although the core glycolytic enzymes and their chemical mechanisms are deeply conserved, the regulatory architectures that tune glycolytic flux have diverged markedly between taxa and between tissues. Trypanosomatid PFKs are markedly smaller than their human counterparts and lack the N-terminal and C-terminal regulatory domains found in mammalian isoforms. Structural analyses have shown that trypanosome PFK toggles between inactive T-state and active R-state conformations via a mobile loop that repositions catalytic residues in the active site, enabling phosphoryl transfer only in the R-state. This conformational switching is coupled to a discrete allosteric pocket that is absent from human PFK isoforms, raising the possibility that small molecules could selectively lock the parasite enzyme in its inactive conformation without perturbing host glycolysis. Yet, prior to this work, there were no drug-like, parasite-selective allosteric PFK inhibitors with demonstrated in vivo efficacy.\n\nHere, we use a structure-based drug design strategy to discover and optimize a family of fast-acting, allosteric inhibitors of T. brucei PFK (TbPFK). Guided by fragment screening and co-crystal structures, we identify a dichlorophenyl-containing pharmacophore that binds in a deep allosteric pocket adjacent to the active site and stabilizes the inactive T-state of the enzyme. Iterative medicinal chemistry around this scaffold yields a series of pyrrolopyridine derivatives with nanomolar potency against TbPFK, favourable thermodynamic and kinetic binding parameters, and a well-defined binding pose that exploits a trypanosome-specific pocket not present in human PFK isoforms. These compounds show a tight correlation between enzyme inhibition and parasite killing, with basic analogues displaying improved uptake into glycosomes and markedly enhanced trypanocidal activity. In bloodstream-form parasites, TbPFK inhibition triggers a precipitous collapse in ATP levels and results in >99% killing within minutes, a time-to-kill far faster than that of current clinical agents or other experimental trypanocides.\n\nPharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in mice demonstrate that lead compounds from this series are orally bioavailable, achieve plasma concentrations well above their in vitro EC50 and penetrate the CNS. In an acute T. brucei infection model, single-day oral dosing regimens completely clear parasitaemia and produce durable cure, while in a more stringent bioluminescent model that recapitulates parasite dissemination to extravascular tissues, the compounds markedly reduce parasite burden in both peripheral organs and brain. Notably, the inhibitors are exquisitely selective for trypanosomatid PFK, with no detectable activity against any of the three human PFK isoforms at concentrations orders of magnitude higher than those required for parasite killing. Together, these data establish trypanosome PFK as a tractable, species-specific drug target, overturn the notion that glycolytic enzymes are inherently “undruggable,” and illustrate how evolutionary divergence in allosteric regulatory mechanisms can be leveraged to develop safe and potent inhibitors of a pathway that is otherwise nearly universal.",

    "text": "The work presented here establishes trypanosome phosphofructokinase as a tractable and highly vulnerable drug target, overturning the long-standing view that core glycolytic enzymes are intrinsically problematic for selective chemotherapy. Using structure-based design guided by an unusual allosteric pocket, we developed pyrrolopyridine inhibitors that bind TbPFK with nanomolar affinity, lock the tetramer in its inactive T-state, and trigger extremely rapid ATP collapse and parasite death, while sparing all three human PFK isoforms even at micromolar concentrations. In murine models, these compounds display favourable pharmacokinetics, oral bioavailability, and central nervous system penetration and can cure acute T. brucei infection after a single day of dosing. \n\nA central conceptual advance is the demonstration that glycolysis can be targeted safely by exploiting divergent allosteric regulation rather than conserved active sites. Bloodstream-form T. brucei is metabolically constrained: oxidative phosphorylation is essentially absent, and ATP production depends almost exclusively on glycolytic flux within glycosomes. The extreme reliance of the parasite on this single pathway predicts a steep pharmacodynamic relationship between inhibition of flux and loss of viability, which is borne out by the time-to-kill experiments. A brief exposure to low micromolar concentrations of the lead compounds abolishes ATP production and kills >99% of parasites within 30 minutes, far faster than reference trypanocidal agents acting on other pathways. This kinetic profile is precisely what one would expect from acutely poisoning the sole ATP-generating process in a cell unable to buffer energy charge with mitochondrial respiration.\n\nAt the molecular level, the structural data provide a coherent mechanistic explanation for both potency and species specificity. TbPFK exhibits classical T-state and R-state conformations, but unlike human PFK isoforms, the conformational switch is controlled by a compact regulatory segment rather than large N-terminal and C-terminal domains. The CTCB series binds a deep allosteric pocket contiguous with the mobile activation loop that carries Asp229 and Asp231, the catalytic residues that coordinate fructose 6-phosphate and MgATP. By wedging into this pocket and engaging Leu232 and neighbouring residues, the inhibitors prevent the loop from adopting the R-state position compatible with catalysis. This “conformational trap” model is supported by kinetics showing a non-competitive reduction in V_max for both ATP and fructose 6-phosphate and by the absence of steric clash between inhibitor and substrates in the co-crystal structures. The allosteric site is not detectable in any human PFK isoform, consistent with the complete lack of inhibition of hPFK-M, hPFK-L, or hPFK-P at concentrations >100 µM. Together, these results illustrate how lineage-specific allosteric solutions to a conserved catalytic problem can be exploited for highly selective inhibition.\n\nThe structure–activity relationships highlight a second important theme: the need to engineer not just binding but intracellular access to a glycosomal target. Across multiple scaffolds, enzyme IC₅₀ and cellular EC₅₀ correlate when the compounds are basic, whereas neutral and acidic analogues show disproportionately poor parasite killing despite potent TbPFK inhibition. This behaviour is consistent with pK_a-dependent uptake and/or trapping within the parasite and its glycosomes. The dichlorophenyl group, particularly the meta-chloro substituent, contributes to affinity through a well-defined halogen bond to Gly197, while the N5 aminoalkyl chain of the pyrrolopyridine establishes a hydrogen bond to Asp199 and additional electrostatic contacts. Small modifications that maintain this interaction network but tune lipophilicity and basicity produce substantial differences in oral bioavailability, plasma protein binding, and brain penetration, underlining the narrow medicinal chemistry corridor that must be navigated for central nervous system-penetrant anti-trypanosomal agents.\n\nThe pharmacokinetic and in vivo efficacy data suggest that these inhibitors have a realistic path to clinical translation, particularly for stage 1 disease. Lead compounds are well tolerated in mice at high cumulative doses, show no obvious hepatotoxicity, and achieve free plasma concentrations in the low micromolar range that exceed the cellular EC₅₀ values. The observed brain:plasma ratios and unbound brain fractions indicate that free drug levels in the interstitial fluid of the brain reach at least half those in the circulation, a favourable property for a target that must ultimately be addressed within the central nervous system. In the acute Lister 427 model, regimens as short as a single day with thrice-administered doses produce sterile cure by standard criteria. In the more stringent pleiomorphic GVR35 model, treatment at both stage 1 and stage 2 substantially reduces parasite load in blood and brain, confirming compound activity in extravascular compartments, even though the regimens tested were not optimised to achieve sterile cure.\n\nThese findings also define the key limitations and areas for further optimisation. First, washout experiments reveal a small subpopulation of parasites that survive short exposures, requiring sustained drug concentrations for complete killing. One plausible explanation is cell-cycle-linked heterogeneity in ATP demand, but alternative mechanisms—including variability in compound uptake, glycosome permeability, or pre-existing TbPFK mutations—remain to be explored. Longitudinal resistance-selection experiments, coupled to sequencing of the TbPFK locus and metabolomic profiling, will be important to understand the genetic barrier to resistance and whether the parasite can rewire carbon metabolism to escape glycolytic blockade. Second, although the current series crosses the blood–brain barrier, the failure to sterilise the stage 2 model under non-maximised dosing suggests that either higher or more prolonged exposures, or rational combinations with drugs targeting distinct pathways or tissue niches, may be necessary for robust late-stage cure.\n\nBeyond human African trypanosomiasis, this work has broader implications for anti-infective and antiproliferative drug discovery. Many pathogens and cancer cells operate close to their energetic limits, with glycolysis or other central metabolic pathways acting as bottlenecks. The strategy used here—identifying lineage-specific or isoform-specific allosteric control elements on otherwise highly conserved enzymes, then using structural information to design conformational traps—should be generalisable to other systems. In that sense, trypanosome PFK serves as a proof-of-concept that “undruggable” core metabolic nodes can be converted into selective Achilles’ heels.\n\nTaken together, our data provide a compelling demonstration that allosteric inhibition of TbPFK is a fast-acting, selective, and pharmacologically tractable approach to controlling T. brucei infection. The challenge now is to translate these properties into regimens and combinations capable of delivering safe, short-course cures across the full clinical spectrum of human African trypanosomiasis, while leveraging the same design principles to open up analogous vulnerabilities in other parasitic and proliferative diseases.",

    "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has exposed the fragility of our antiviral armamentarium against emerging respiratory RNA viruses. While neutralizing antibodies and vaccines rapidly reached the clinic, direct-acting small-molecule antivirals have remained comparatively scarce. Remdesivir and later oral protease inhibitors such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir have demonstrated clinical benefit, but their deployment is constrained by route of administration, cost, supply, and a narrow therapeutic window early in infection. Against this backdrop, repurposing of existing broad-spectrum RNA virus inhibitors has been vigorously pursued as a rapid strategy to expand treatment options for COVID-19, often in advance of robust preclinical data linking pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and mechanism of action.\n\nFavipiravir (T-705) is an orally available pyrazinecarboxamide derivative originally developed for influenza and approved in Japan for treatment of pandemic and refractory influenza infections. After intracellular conversion to its ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate metabolite, favipiravir is recognized by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases as a purine nucleoside analog. It can act both as a non-obligate chain terminator and as a mutagenic substrate that drives excess incorporation of transition mutations, ultimately pushing viral populations toward error catastrophe. This dual mechanism underlies its reported activity against a broad spectrum of RNA viruses, including orthomyxoviruses, arenaviruses, filoviruses, bunyaviruses, and flaviviruses. Limited in vitro studies with SARS-CoV-2, however, have yielded relatively high 50% effective concentrations (EC₅₀) in the high micromolar range, varying markedly across cell types, raising doubts about whether clinically tolerable dosing can achieve antiviral exposures in vivo.\n\nDespite these uncertainties, favipiravir has been advanced into multiple clinical trials for COVID-19, often under emergency-use or compassionate-use frameworks. Early open-label and non-randomized studies reported heterogeneous effects on viral clearance and clinical endpoints, and many were underpowered or lacked rigorous virological sampling. Interpreting these results is further complicated by the complex and nonlinear pharmacokinetics of favipiravir in humans. The drug undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism predominantly via aldehyde oxidase, exhibits auto-inhibition of its own clearance at higher concentrations, and displays substantial inter-individual variability in plasma exposure. Without well-controlled preclinical studies that define the exposure–response relationship in a relevant infection model and clarify the extent to which lethal mutagenesis contributes to antiviral activity against coronaviruses in vivo, it is difficult to rationally design dosing regimens or to interpret negative clinical outcomes.\n\nThe Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has emerged as a robust small-animal model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal inoculation with clinical isolates leads to high viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract, focal to diffuse broncho-interstitial pneumonia, vascular lesions reminiscent of those described in severe human COVID-19, and reproducible changes in body weight. Peak lung viral titers typically occur around 2–3 days post-infection, with spontaneous virological and clinical recovery by approximately one week. These features, combined with the small size and ease of handling, make the hamster an attractive system for quantitative evaluation of candidate antivirals and for dissecting relationships among drug exposure, viral replication, tissue pathology, and clinical readouts.\n\nA critical outstanding question is whether favipiravir, at exposures that are even conceivably attainable in humans, can meaningfully suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung tissue and ameliorate disease in vivo, and if so, by what mechanism. In particular, it is important to determine (i) the doses required to reduce infectious viral titers and histopathological damage in the lung under realistic preemptive or preventive dosing schedules, (ii) how favipiravir distributes between plasma and lung and how non-linear pharmacokinetics and drug accumulation shape the antiviral exposure window, and (iii) whether measurable changes in the intrahost SARS-CoV-2 mutational spectrum correlate with reductions in viral infectivity, consistent with lethal mutagenesis as a dominant mode of action in vivo.\n\nHere, we address these questions using a rigorously characterized Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We combine dose-ranging favipiravir regimens administered intraperitoneally in preemptive and preventive schedules with quantitative virology, lung histopathology, and clinical monitoring. We integrate these data with detailed plasma and lung pharmacokinetic measurements and deep sequencing of viral genomes from lung tissue to map drug-induced mutation patterns and their relationship to viral infectivity. By defining the pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic profile and mutational signatures associated with favipiravir treatment in this model, our study delineates the conditions under which high-dose favipiravir can exert antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, clarifies the trade-off between efficacy and toxicity, and provides a framework for judging the translational plausibility of high-dose regimens for prophylaxis or very early therapy in humans.",

    "text": "We show here that high-dose favipiravir exerts potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the Syrian hamster model, but only within a relatively narrow pharmacological window defined by non-linear pharmacokinetics, lung penetration, and emerging toxicity. Preventive or preemptive administration at the highest doses tested led to reductions of up to ~3–4 log₁₀ in lung infectious titers, substantial decreases in plasma viral RNA, and marked improvement in lung histopathology and weight trajectories, especially when treatment was initiated before or on the day of infection. These data provide in vivo support for favipiravir as a direct-acting antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and illustrate how robust antiviral activity can be achieved in a small-animal model despite the presence of coronavirus proofreading machinery. \n\nA striking feature of our results is the discrepancy between the magnitude of the effect on infectious titers and the more modest effect on viral RNA loads, both in lung tissue and plasma. Across multiple inocula and dosing regimens, favipiravir reduced infectious virus far more than total RNA and substantially decreased the infectivity ratio (infectious units per RNA molecule). Together with the sequencing data, which show a dose-dependent increase in the number of sub-consensus mutations per genome, particularly G→A and C→U transitions, this pattern is most parsimoniously explained by lethal mutagenesis rather than pure chain termination. The enrichment for transition mutations and the increase in non-synonymous variants with escalating doses are exactly what one would expect from a nucleoside analogue that is ambiguously paired and repeatedly incorporated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, pushing the virus toward an error threshold at which progeny genomes are no longer fit to sustain productive infection.\n\nThese findings are notable in the context of coronaviruses, which possess a 3′–5′ exoribonuclease (nsp14) that normally enhances replication fidelity and can attenuate the effects of mutagenic nucleoside analogues. The fact that we observe a several-fold increase in total mutations per genome and a clear inverse correlation between infectious titers and the frequency of non-synonymous and G→A mutations indicates that, at sufficiently high exposures, favipiravir can at least partially overcome this proofreading barrier. The detection of recurrent, parallel mutations in multiple treated animals, affecting nsp2, nsp3–6, nsp14, structural proteins (N, M), and accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF8), hints at complex adaptive dynamics under mutagenic pressure. At this stage, it is unclear whether these parallel changes primarily reflect host adaptation to the hamster lung, compensatory responses to the increased mutational load, or incipient resistance pathways; disentangling these possibilities will require longitudinal experiments and reverse genetics.\n\nOur pharmacokinetic data highlight several challenges for translating these results into a clinical setting. After intraperitoneal administration, favipiravir displayed non-linear pharmacokinetics, with supra-proportional increases in exposure and substantial accumulation over 3 days of TID dosing. Average plasma concentrations achieved at the two higher doses overlap with or exceed those reported in high-dose human regimens, and lung levels reached approximately one-half to two-thirds of plasma levels, consistent with good but incomplete pulmonary penetration. Importantly, these are also the exposure ranges at which we observed clear evidence of toxicity, manifested as sustained weight loss in both infected and uninfected hamsters at 75 mg/day TID and more modest but detectable effects at 37.5 mg/day TID. The close juxtaposition of efficacious and toxic exposures in this model suggests a narrow therapeutic index, with limited room to further escalate dose to compensate for interindividual variability or suboptimal timing in humans.\n\nFrom a translational perspective, our data argue that favipiravir is most likely to be beneficial, if at all, when deployed very early in the course of infection, or as post-exposure or pre-exposure prophylaxis in high-risk settings. In our hands, delaying treatment beyond the day of infection was not systematically explored; however, the steep decline in viral loads in untreated hamsters by 5–7 days post-infection, and the requirement for high exposures to suppress viral replication at peak titers, make it plausible that later initiation would substantially diminish efficacy. The hamster model also captures predominantly upper and mid–respiratory tract replication and mild clinical disease, raising the possibility that favipiravir’s impact on late, inflammation-driven pathology in severe human COVID-19 may be limited even if early viral suppression is achieved.\n\nOur findings also have implications for clinical safety and for the evolutionary consequences of suboptimal dosing. A mutagenic mechanism of action means that doses that fall short of the error-catastrophe threshold could, in principle, increase genetic diversity without fully abrogating viral replication, potentially accelerating the exploration of sequence space. In our experiments, however, increased mutational burden was tightly coupled to loss of infectivity, and we did not observe the emergence of dominant, high-frequency escape variants over the short experimental window. Whether longer-term or repeated exposure, particularly in partially immune hosts, could select for favipiravir-tolerant SARS-CoV-2 lineages remains an open question and argues for careful genomic surveillance in clinical trials using high-dose favipiravir regimens.\n\nSeveral limitations should be considered when extrapolating from our work. We used young, immunocompetent female hamsters infected intranasally with a single viral strain; host age, sex, comorbidities, and viral variant may all influence favipiravir pharmacodynamics and toxicity. Intraperitoneal administration bypasses first-pass metabolism and may not fully recapitulate the oral pharmacokinetics encountered in patients. Our observation window was relatively short and focused on virologic and histopathological outcomes; we did not explore long-term sequelae, adaptive immune responses, or the potential for combination therapy with other direct-acting antivirals or immunomodulators. Finally, while we show that efficacious exposures are broadly within the range achieved in some human dosing regimens, interspecies differences in metabolism and toxicity prevent any straightforward extrapolation of dose.\n\nIn summary, the Syrian hamster model reveals that favipiravir, given at high doses, can substantially reduce SARS-CoV-2 infectious titers, ameliorate lung pathology, and drive viral populations toward lethal mutagenesis in vivo, but at the cost of appreciable host toxicity and with a narrow margin between efficacious and adverse exposures. These results both support the biological plausibility of favipiravir as an antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and caution against over-interpretation of modest clinical signals obtained with lower or late dosing. More broadly, they underscore the value of well-characterized animal models and integrated virological, pharmacokinetic, and deep-sequencing readouts to rationally evaluate repurposed nucleoside analogues before large-scale deployment in human trials.",

    "text": "Neurons are among the most long-lived cells in the human body and must maintain a single, nonreplicating genome for decades. Unlike proliferative cells, they cannot dilute DNA lesions through cell division, which makes them uniquely dependent on a limited repertoire of DNA repair pathways—base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and double-strand break repair—to preserve genome integrity across a lifetime. Failures in these pathways cause a spectrum of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring that the nervous system is exquisitely sensitive to defects in the DNA damage response (DDR) and repair machinery. Yet, despite an extensive catalog of DNA repair factors and pathways, we still have only a fragmentary understanding of how repair activity is actually deployed along the neuronal genome in situ.\n\nRecent advances in single-cell genomics have sharpened the problem. Whole-genome sequencing of individual human neurons has shown that somatic single-nucleotide variants accumulate steadily with age, at rates on the order of tens of mutations per neuron per year, and that this burden is further elevated in neurodegenerative disease. These studies reveal that neuronal genomes are not static archives but dynamic records of lifetime DNA damage and repair. However, they provide only the end result of successful and failed repair; they do not reveal where repair pathways are most active, or how neurons may preferentially protect specific functional elements—such as long genes required for synaptic transmission, transcriptional regulators of neuronal identity, or evolutionarily constrained noncoding elements—from accumulating irreversible damage.\n\nAt the same time, work on the DDR in the nervous system has suggested that DNA damage is not purely deleterious “noise.” Activity-dependent double-strand breaks at promoters of early-response genes, for example, appear to facilitate rapid transcriptional induction during learning and memory, linking regulated DNA breakage and repair to neuronal plasticity. Moreover, mutations or misregulation of DDR factors such as FUS and HDAC1 perturb both DNA repair and transcription and are implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and related disorders, reinforcing the idea that genome maintenance and gene regulation are tightly coupled in neurons. A central unresolved question is therefore not only how much damage neurons incur, but how they spatially organize repair capacity across the genome to support both long-term survival and specialized function.\n\nGenome-wide mapping of DNA repair has begun to address analogous questions in dividing cells. Excision repair sequencing (XR-seq) and related methods that capture and sequence excised oligonucleotide repair products have generated high-resolution maps of nucleotide excision repair in response to ultraviolet light and chemical carcinogens, revealing strong biases imposed by chromatin state, transcription-coupled repair, and three-dimensional genome architecture. However, these approaches target specific lesions and have been applied primarily in proliferative systems. For terminally differentiated neurons, where DNA synthesis is largely uncoupled from replication, we lack a general method to measure where nonreplicative repair synthesis occurs genome-wide, irrespective of the initial lesion or repair pathway. As a consequence, fundamental questions remain unanswered: Do neurons distribute repair uniformly, in proportion to transcriptional activity, or do they concentrate repair at discrete hotspots? Are these putative hotspots linked to particular chromatin features, RNA-processing machinery, or evolutionarily conserved elements? And how are such patterns perturbed by neuronal activity, exogenous DNA damage, or aging?\n\nAddressing these questions requires a strategy that can label and recover sites of repair-associated DNA synthesis in postmitotic cells with high specificity and genomic resolution. Here, we develop such an approach by exploiting the nonreplicative incorporation of the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) into DNA repair patches in human embryonic stem cell–derived induced neurons (ESC-iNs). By coupling EdU labeling to click chemistry–based enrichment and next-generation sequencing, we establish a method—Repair-seq—that directly profiles the genomic distribution of DNA repair synthesis in postmitotic human neurons. Applying Repair-seq, we identify tens of thousands of discrete DNA repair hotspots that occupy a small fraction of the genome yet are strongly enriched near promoters, untranslated regions, and gene bodies of neuronal identity genes, as well as in evolutionarily constrained and epigenetic clock–linked elements. We further integrate Repair-seq with chromatin accessibility, histone modification, three-dimensional genome architecture, and proteomic analyses to define a chromatin- and RNA-binding–protein–rich environment at these sites and to explore how neuronal activity, exogenous damage, and age-associated epigenetic remodeling reshape the landscape of genome maintenance in human neurons.",

    "text": "Neurons must maintain genome integrity over decades in the absence of DNA replication, yet the spatial logic by which they deploy limited repair capacity has remained obscure. By exploiting nonreplicative incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) and a targeted sequencing strategy, we show that human induced neurons concentrate DNA repair into a discrete landscape of DNA repair hotspots (DRHs) that occupy only a small fraction of the genome but are strongly enriched at genes and regulatory elements essential for neuronal identity and function. This organization suggests that long-lived postmitotic cells preserve their genomes not by uniformly surveying all loci, but by prioritizing a protected subcompartment of critical sequence elements.\n\nA central finding is that the global pattern of EdU incorporation recapitulates the expected bias of repair toward transcribed genes, yet recurrent DRHs themselves are largely uncoupled from steady-state transcriptional output. Most of the neuronal transcriptome shows some repair activity, consistent with transcription-coupled repair and earlier observations that active genes are preferentially protected from damage. However, the subset of reproducible hotspots does not scale with expression level and frequently resides in promoter-proximal regions, 5′ untranslated regions, and intragenic elements, as well as in intergenic regions associated with active chromatin. This dissociation argues that DRHs are not merely a by-product of high transcriptional flux, but rather mark specialized domains where repair is repeatedly invoked, perhaps to stabilize regulatory architectures or sequence features that are intrinsically damage-prone.\n\nThe chromatin and protein composition of DRHs further supports the idea that they constitute organized repair platforms. DRHs are preferentially located in open chromatin and A compartments of the three-dimensional genome, yet many occur outside classical promoter and enhancer annotations, suggesting that topology and local chromatin environment jointly constrain where persistent repair occurs. The enrichment of histone H2A isoforms, including H2AZ, together with RNA-binding proteins on repaired chromatin points to a mechanistic link between nucleosome composition, RNA processing, and repair synthesis. H2A variants have been implicated in both DNA damage signaling and transcriptional regulation, and RNA-binding proteins associated with splicing, RNA export, and R-loop metabolism are well positioned to couple co-transcriptional structures to repair pathway choice. The decline in abundance of many of these DRH-associated proteins in Alzheimer’s disease brains raises the possibility that disruption of this integrated chromatin–RNA–repair module contributes to genome and transcriptome instability in neurodegeneration.\n\nOur data refine current models of neuronal activity–associated DNA damage. In mice, neuronal stimulation induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and γH2AX accumulation at specific immediate-early genes, and this damage has been proposed to facilitate rapid transcriptional responses. In human ESC-derived neurons, however, acute depolarization produces minimal remodeling of the DRH landscape, whereas chronic suppression of spontaneous activity with tetrodotoxin reduces repair at many hotspots. Together with the weak correspondence between DRHs and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites linked to topoisomerase IIβ–dependent breaks, these observations suggest that in human neurons, activity shapes the basal pattern of repair over longer timescales rather than driving large waves of new repair synthesis at discrete loci during acute stimulation. Alternatively, activity-induced lesions may be repaired via pathways that require little or no DNA synthesis and therefore escape EdU labeling, or γH2AX foci in this context may not always correspond to bona fide DSBs. Dissecting these possibilities will require integrating Repair-seq with orthogonal assays for specific lesion classes and repair pathways.\n\nThe relationship between DRHs, somatic mutation, and evolutionary conservation offers a framework for thinking about how neurons balance stability and flexibility over the human life span. Somatic single-nucleotide variants in single neurons appear broadly distributed across the genome and are not enriched at DRHs, indicating that recurrently repaired loci are not major sites of mutational accumulation in the aging brain. Instead, DRHs are preferentially located near genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP)–defined constrained elements and are more likely to contain single bases under strong purifying selection than are somatic mutation sites. This pattern is consistent with a model in which neurons repeatedly invest repair resources at evolutionarily constrained positions to minimize both unrepaired lesions and error-prone repair outcomes. In this view, the “cost” of leaving many genomic regions relatively underprotected is offset by the benefit of preserving an essential subset of regulatory and coding elements that are intolerant to change.\n\nOur results also provide a potential mechanistic bridge between DNA repair and epigenetic aging. CpG sites that define neuronal DNA methylation–based epigenetic clocks show a striking spatial relationship to DRHs. This colocalization raises the possibility that the same loci that are repeatedly engaged by repair machinery are also the ones whose methylation states drift in a stereotyped fashion with age. Repeated cycles of damage and repair, especially if coupled to active DNA demethylation or remethylation, could bias the long-term dynamics of CpG methylation at these sites and thereby encode a cumulative record of genome maintenance history. Genotoxic stress experiments with neocarzinostatin support a dynamic picture in which DNA damage can both generate and extinguish hotspots, while a core set of DRHs linked to clock CpGs and constrained elements remains comparatively stable. As repair capacity declines and genome-wide damage burdens increase with age, this architecture may be strained, redistributing repair away from these privileged sites and contributing to loss of epigenetic and transcriptional homeostasis.\n\nThe present study has several limitations. First, ESC-derived induced neurons provide a scalable and genetically tractable model of human cortical neurons, but they do not fully recapitulate the maturation state, diversity, or environmental context of adult human neurons in vivo. Second, EdU-based Repair-seq selectively captures repair events that involve DNA synthesis over a 24-hour labeling window and will underrepresent pathways such as short-patch base excision repair or ligation-only end joining, as well as any process that is incompatible with efficient EdU incorporation. Third, we infer lesion classes and pathway usage indirectly from genomic and proteomic context; direct mapping of specific damage types (for example, oxidative lesions or R-loop–associated breaks) will be needed to connect individual repair hotspots to biochemical mechanisms. Finally, our data provide static and acute perturbation snapshots rather than longitudinal trajectories of repair during aging.\n\nDespite these caveats, mapping DRHs in human neurons establishes a conceptual and technical framework for interrogating genome maintenance in long-lived cells. The Repair-seq strategy can, in principle, be generalized to other postmitotic cell types such as cardiomyocytes, skeletal muscle, and glia, as well as to in vivo systems and organoid models. Future work integrating Repair-seq with single-cell transcriptomics, long-read sequencing, and chromatin conformation profiling should reveal how repair landscapes vary across neuronal subtypes and developmental stages, how they are remodeled by disease-associated mutations, and whether they can be manipulated to enhance genome stability. More broadly, the identification of a privileged repair subcompartment suggests that neuronal longevity is underwritten not by a homogeneous genome-wide vigilance, but by a highly structured and evolutionarily informed allocation of repair capacity to the most functionally irreplaceable parts of the genome.",

    "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related death, accounting for roughly 10% of global cancer incidence and about 9–10% of cancer mortality. Population-based screening with fecal occult blood tests or fecal immunochemical tests and colonoscopy has been shown to reduce CRC incidence and mortality by enabling detection and removal of advanced precursors and early-stage cancers. Nonetheless, uptake of screening remains suboptimal in many settings, and current “one-size-fits-all” age-based recommendations may over-screen individuals at low risk while failing to adequately target those at highest risk. More efficient, risk-adapted screening strategies that preferentially channel colonoscopy and intensive surveillance to individuals at elevated risk have therefore emerged as a major goal in CRC prevention.\n\nRisk prediction models for CRC have so far relied primarily on environmental and lifestyle factors—such as smoking, body mass index, diet, physical activity, and family history—or on germline genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) that aggregate dozens to hundreds of common risk alleles modestly improve discrimination when added to models based on age and classic risk factors, but typical areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) remain in the range of ~0.60–0.65. Similarly, environmental risk scores (ERS) that combine established lifestyle and clinical determinants of CRC risk usually achieve only modest separation between individuals with and without advanced neoplasia.\n\n While these tools can, in principle, be used to define strata with different absolute risks and corresponding screening recommendations, their limited discriminative ability has constrained their use in practice, and there remains a clear need for biomarkers that capture additional, biologically proximal information about CRC development.\n\nCirculating microRNAs (miRNAs) are attractive candidates in this regard. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression, and they are actively released into the circulation in association with protein complexes or extracellular vesicles, where they are remarkably stable. Tissue and tumor-specific miRNA expression patterns are well documented, and numerous studies have reported differential levels of circulating miRNAs in patients with CRC compared with controls. Panels incorporating miR-21, miR-92a, and related species, for example, have shown promising diagnostic performance for distinguishing prevalent CRC from cancer-free individuals in cross-sectional designs. However, most prior work has focused on case–control comparisons using blood samples collected at or after diagnosis, making it difficult to disentangle markers of established disease from markers that signal increased risk years before clinical presentation. Prospective data on circulating miRNAs measured in pre-diagnostic samples, and on their performance relative to established ERS and PRS, are still scarce.\n\nFrom a screening perspective, it is precisely such pre-diagnostic markers that are most valuable: biomarkers that report on early carcinogenic processes or on host susceptibility long before symptoms arise, and that can be measured non-invasively in blood. If circulating miRNA profiles reflect early field effects in the colorectum, systemic responses to emerging lesions, or constitutional differences in regulatory networks, they might provide an orthogonal dimension of information to both environmental and germline genetic scores. Integrating such markers into risk models could sharpen individual-level risk estimates, thereby helping to identify subgroups that would benefit from colonoscopy as a primary screening modality, as well as those for whom less invasive testing and longer screening intervals might be appropriate.\n\nIn this context, we conducted a two-step investigation to develop and evaluate a blood-based miRNA risk score for CRC in a population-based setting. In a discovery phase, we used next-generation sequencing to profile circulating miRNAs in a retrospective case–control series and selected differentially expressed miRNAs, which we supplemented with additional candidates identified from the literature. In a second phase, we quantified this candidate set by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in pre-diagnostic serum samples from a large prospective cohort of adults aged 50–75 years, with up to 14 years of follow-up and detailed information on environmental and genetic risk factors. Using logistic regression, we derived a 7-miRNA risk score (miR-score) and assessed its association with subsequent CRC incidence and its discriminative performance, quantified by optimism-corrected AUC. We then compared the miR-score directly with an ERS based on established lifestyle and clinical risk factors and with a PRS constructed from 140 CRC-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, and examined whether combining these scores yields further gains in prediction.\n\nBy evaluating circulating miRNAs in pre-diagnostic samples within a well-characterized prospective cohort, and by benchmarking their performance against both environmental and polygenic scores, this study addresses two key gaps in the current literature: the lack of long-term prospective data on circulating miRNAs and the absence of head-to-head comparisons of molecular, environmental, and genetic risk stratification tools for CRC. Our findings provide insight into the extent to which a compact panel of circulating miRNAs can predict CRC risk years before diagnosis and inform the development of risk-adapted CRC screening strategies.",

    "text": "This study demonstrates that a circulating microRNA–based risk score derived from pre-diagnostic serum samples can stratify long-term colorectal cancer risk with substantially higher discriminatory accuracy than widely used environmental and polygenic scores. The 7-miRNA score achieved an optimism-corrected area under the ROC curve of approximately 0.80, both in the full prospective set and in the subset with complete genetic and environmental information, and individuals in the highest quintile of the score had more than a seven-fold higher odds of developing colorectal cancer compared with those in the middle quintile. In contrast, an environmental risk score based on established lifestyle and medical risk factors, and a polygenic risk score aggregating 140 known susceptibility loci, each showed only modest discrimination, and combining them yielded only minor improvements. These findings suggest that circulating miRNAs, measured once in late midlife, capture a risk signal for colorectal cancer that is not adequately represented by current genetic and environmental models. \n\nOur results extend previous work on circulating miRNAs and colorectal cancer in several important ways. Most earlier studies focused on diagnostic settings, comparing miRNA profiles between patients with established tumors and neoplasm-free controls, leaving uncertain whether observed differences reflect long-standing risk or short-term consequences of tumor presence or progression. By leveraging a population-based cohort with up to 14 years of follow-up and a median lag of nearly 7 years between blood sampling and diagnosis, we show that a small set of serum miRNAs is already differentially expressed long before clinical detection. The relatively stable discrimination across early and later follow-up intervals further supports the interpretation that these miRNAs capture long-term predisposition or very early steps of tumorigenesis rather than transient changes immediately preceding diagnosis.\n\nThe comparative analysis with polygenic and environmental scores also provides mechanistic clues. The environmental score integrates major behavioral and clinical risk factors, while the polygenic score aggregates inherited variation across many loci. The miRNA score, in contrast, reflects a composite of tumor-derived signals, host tissue responses, and systemic processes such as inflammation, metabolism, and immune surveillance. That the miRNA score so clearly outperforms both germline and exposure-based models suggests that much of the actionable risk for colorectal cancer may be encoded in dynamic molecular phenotypes that lie downstream of both genetic susceptibility and lifestyle, rather than in those components alone. In other words, circulating miRNAs may function as integrative “readouts” of accumulated carcinogenic processes, including those that are not yet clinically apparent.\n\nThe individual miRNAs contributing to the score are consistent with this interpretation. Members of the let-7, miR-23, miR-92, miR-19, miR-21, miR-27, and miR-144 families have previously been implicated in pathways central to colorectal carcinogenesis, including Wnt/β-catenin signaling, cell-cycle control, apoptosis, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Although the direction of association for some miRNAs in pre-diagnostic serum differs from reports in diagnostic samples, this discrepancy is biologically plausible. Expression changes at very early, preclinical stages of tumor development need not mirror patterns observed in established tumors, and circulating levels may reflect a mixture of tumor secretion, stroma–epithelium crosstalk, and systemic responses. The multivariable modeling strategy explicitly accommodates such complexity: the logistic regression–derived score exploits correlations among miRNAs to maximize discrimination, rather than relying on the marginal effect of any single marker.\n\nFrom a clinical and public-health perspective, these findings underscore the potential of circulating miRNAs as tools for risk-adapted colorectal cancer screening. Current “one-size-fits-all” guidelines based primarily on age are inefficient: many individuals undergo repeated colonoscopies despite low risk, while others at substantially elevated risk remain unidentified. Polygenic scores and environmental models have been proposed to refine screening, but their performance to date has been modest. A blood-based test that can be obtained in primary care, and that stratifies individuals into low‐ and high-risk categories with AUCs around 0.8, could help prioritize colonoscopy or intensive stool-based testing for those most likely to benefit, and potentially justify less intensive surveillance in those at very low predicted risk. Such an approach might increase the yield of advanced neoplasia per colonoscopy, improve adherence by limiting invasive procedures to those at highest risk, and reduce overall costs.\n\nAt the same time, several limitations warrant caution before translation into practice. First, although the study is embedded in a large, well-characterized cohort, the nested case–control sample size remains moderate, and model development and evaluation were performed in the same underlying cohort. The use of bootstrap-based optimism correction reduces but does not eliminate concerns about overfitting; independent external validation in other cohorts, ideally with different ethnic and risk profiles, is essential. Second, all participants were older adults from a single country, and it is unknown whether the same miRNA combination and coefficients will generalize to younger populations, to settings with different environmental exposures, or to populations with distinct genetic architectures of colorectal cancer risk. Third, we measured miRNAs in a single baseline serum sample; intra-individual variability, long-term temporal stability, and the impact of pre-analytical conditions (such as fasting status, sample handling, and subtle hemolysis) on the score require more detailed characterization.\n\nAnother important question is the degree to which the miRNA score reflects occult prevalent, but as yet undiagnosed, colorectal cancers at baseline rather than purely future incident disease. Although sensitivity analyses stratified by follow-up time suggest reasonably consistent predictive performance when restricting to diagnoses more than three years after blood draw, some influence of subclinical disease cannot be excluded. Future studies incorporating serial sampling and complementary imaging or stool-based assessments could help disentangle markers of long-standing risk from those of very early, screen-detectable neoplasia. Moreover, it will be important to assess calibration and net reclassification improvement when adding the miRNA score to existing risk models, and to evaluate whether such reclassification translates into improved benefit–harm profiles in realistic screening strategies using decision-analytic modeling.\n\nFinally, beyond its immediate predictive utility, the identified miRNA panel offers a starting point for mechanistic work. Dissecting the cellular sources of these miRNAs, their packaging in extracellular vesicles versus protein complexes, and their targets in colonic epithelium and the tumor microenvironment may provide insights into early colorectal carcinogenesis and identify novel preventive or therapeutic targets. Integration of miRNA profiles with other circulating biomarkers, such as DNA methylation markers, cell-free tumor DNA, proteins, and metabolites, might further enhance risk prediction and clarify the biological pathways that drive the transition from risk state to overt cancer.\n\nIn summary, we show that a simple 7-miRNA serum score measured years before diagnosis can predict colorectal cancer occurrence with substantially higher accuracy than established environmental and polygenic risk scores in a population-based cohort of older adults. If validated externally and shown to improve the efficiency and equity of screening when embedded within real-world risk-adapted algorithms, such a blood-based miRNA signature could represent a practical step toward molecularly informed colorectal cancer prevention.",

Proteomic mapping of SOX6 complexes in K562 erythroid cells revealed NonO as a direct SOX6-interacting partner.

    "text": "Human β-hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia, remain among the most prevalent monogenic disorders worldwide and are major causes of morbidity and early mortality. A unifying feature of these conditions is that their clinical severity is profoundly modified by levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, α₂γ₂). Individuals with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH), in whom γ-globin expression escapes developmental silencing, are largely protected from the consequences of β-globin mutations, and pharmacologic or genetic strategies that raise HbF ameliorate disease in both preclinical models and patients. These observations have placed the mechanisms that terminate γ-globin transcription at the center of efforts to develop durable, mechanism-based therapies for β-hemoglobinopathies. \n\nThe human β-globin locus is organized as a developmentally ordered cluster of embryonic (ε), fetal (Gγ and Aγ), and adult (δ and β) genes regulated by a distal locus control region and promoter-proximal elements. During the fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switch, γ-globin expression is extinguished in late gestation and early infancy as transcription is redirected to the adult β-globin genes. This transition is orchestrated by a network of erythroid transcription factors and chromatin regulators that integrate lineage specification, developmental stage, and extracellular cues. Among these, the zinc-finger protein BCL11A has emerged as a master repressor whose dosage tightly correlates with HbF levels and whose genetic disruption in adult erythroid cells robustly derepresses γ-globin. Additional repressors, including the BTB/POZ factor ZBTB7A/LRF and the HMG-box protein SOX6, cooperate with BCL11A and the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex to enforce silencing of the fetal globin genes, in part by altering long-range chromatin looping and local nucleosome occupancy at the γ-globin promoters. Nonetheless, the full complement of trans-acting factors that execute the developmental switch at the β-globin locus remains incompletely defined. \n\nGenetic studies in humans point to the γ-globin proximal promoters as privileged integration points for this regulatory network. Naturally occurring point mutations in these promoters that give rise to HPFH cluster within discrete cis-elements, including the −115 region that mediates BCL11A binding and a conserved octamer motif (ATGCAAAT) centered at position −175. The latter motif, originally identified as a core element in immunoglobulin and other inducible promoters, recruits octamer-binding transcription factors and has been implicated in both activation and repression of γ-globin transcription. These cis-acting variants underscore the importance of promoter-proximal control in the fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switch, yet the identity and functional roles of octamer-binding proteins that operate in definitive erythroid cells at the endogenous γ-globin promoters are still poorly understood. \n\nNonO (also known as p54nrb) is a ubiquitously expressed member of the Drosophila behavior/human splicing (DBHS) protein family that shuttles between chromatin and nuclear bodies. Together with its paralogs SFPQ and PSPC1, NonO constitutes a core component of paraspeckles, long non-coding RNA–dependent subnuclear compartments implicated in RNA processing, nuclear retention of edited transcripts, and the buffering of transcriptional responses to stress. Beyond its RNA-binding functions, NonO has been reported to associate with active promoters and with chromatin-modifying complexes, to modulate pluripotency and circadian cell–cycle coupling, and to act as either a transcriptional co-activator or co-repressor in a context-dependent manner. These pleiotropic activities, together with evidence that NonO co-localizes with BCL11A and can be recovered in NuRD-containing complexes, suggest that NonO might interface between nuclear architecture and lineage-specific transcriptional programs in erythroid cells. \n\nHere, we investigate whether NonO contributes directly to developmental silencing of γ-globin. We show that NonO physically interacts with SOX6, binds the conserved octamer motif within the γ-globin proximal promoter, and represses γ-globin transcription in human erythroid cells. Using a combination of loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches in erythroid cell lines, primary adult human erythroblasts, and β-YAC transgenic mice, we demonstrate that NonO is required to maintain silencing of fetal and embryonic globin genes in definitive erythropoiesis, without perturbing erythroid maturation. These findings identify NonO as a previously unrecognized component of the fetal hemoglobin silencing machinery and highlight NonO–SOX6 complexes at the γ-globin promoter as potential targets for therapeutic reactivation of HbF in β-hemoglobinopathies.",

    "text": "In this study we identify the RNA/DNA–binding paraspeckle protein NonO as a previously unrecognized component of the fetal hemoglobin silencing machinery and delineate a direct, evolutionarily conserved role for NonO at the γ-globin promoter. Through a combination of proteomics, biochemical assays, and genetic perturbations in human and murine erythroid systems, we show that NonO interacts with SOX6, occupies the γ-globin proximal promoter, and is required for efficient repression of embryonic and fetal globin genes in adult erythroid cells. \n\nA central finding is that NonO binds the core octamer motif ATGCAAAT in the γ-globin proximal promoter and represses transcription in a dosage-dependent manner. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrate that NonO overexpression is sufficient to diminish γ-promoter activity, whereas mutation of the NonO binding site abrogates this repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays provide convergent evidence that NonO (or a NonO-containing complex) directly recognizes this motif in erythroid nuclei, establishing NonO as a sequence-specific regulator at the β-globin locus rather than a purely architectural or RNA-centric cofactor. This proximal promoter binding is mechanistically complementary to the distal promoter engagement by BCL11A, suggesting that the fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switch is enforced by a distributed network of repressors acting at multiple scales along the locus.\n\nFunctionally, NonO behaves as a bona fide γ-globin silencer in human erythroid cells. In K562 cells, both shRNA-mediated knockdown and CRISPR-mediated knockout of NonO result in robust induction of γ-globin and, notably, embryonic ϵ-globin, without detectable perturbation of key erythroid transcription factors such as GATA1, KLF1, BCL11A, or SOX6, and without overt changes in erythroid maturation. Similar but developmentally more restricted effects are observed in HUDEP-2 cells, where NonO depletion predominantly elevates γ-globin with minimal impact on ϵ-globin, consistent with their more adult-like differentiation status. The most physiologically persuasive data arise from adult primary human erythroblasts, where NonO knockdown leads to ~90-fold induction of γ-globin transcripts and a substantial increase in intracellular HbF protein, again with preserved erythroid differentiation. These observations place NonO in a small class of factors whose perturbation can activate clinically relevant levels of HbF without grossly compromising erythropoiesis.\n\nThe genetic interaction between NonO and SOX6 further refines our understanding of the repressor circuitry at the γ-globin promoter. NonO was identified biochemically as a SOX6-interacting protein, and domain-mapping experiments show that multiple regions of SOX6 can contact NonO, suggesting a flexible protein–protein interface. In both K562 and HUDEP-2 cells, simultaneous depletion of NonO and SOX6 produces an additive increase in γ-globin expression, whereas NonO perturbation alone does not measurably alter SOX6 or BCL11A occupancy at the γ-promoter. These results support a model in which NonO and SOX6 act as partially independent, non-redundant repressors that converge on the same promoter region: SOX6 binding helps nucleate a repressive complex, while NonO provides sequence-specific recognition of the octamer motif and recruits additional corepressors (for example, the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase [NuRD] complex) to enforce transcriptional silencing.\n\nOur data also shed light on the mechanistic consequences of promoter sequence variation, including motifs associated with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Mutation of the –175 T position within the NonO binding site not only disrupts NonO-dependent repression but paradoxically increases promoter activity in the presence of NonO and SOX6. One plausible explanation is that the –175 T-to-C substitution creates or stabilizes a binding site for GATA1–TAL1 or related activator complexes, thereby reconfiguring the local balance between activation and repression. NonO itself is known to act as either activator or repressor in other genomic contexts, depending on its protein partners. The γ-globin promoter therefore likely integrates NonO–SOX6–BCL11A–NuRD–GATA1–TAL1 occupancy in a sequence- and context-dependent fashion, explaining how subtle promoter variants can produce large differences in HbF output.\n\nThe role of NonO in globin regulation is conserved between human and mouse, despite differences in locus organization and developmental timing. NonO depletion in MEL cells reactivates murine embryonic ϵy- and βh1-globin without affecting adult β-globins, mirroring its selective effect on developmentally silenced genes in human cells. Conditional deletion of NonO in adult β-YAC mice, using an Mx1-Cre system to excise a floxed NonO allele in hematopoietic tissues, leads to derepression of both human γ- and ϵ-globin transgenes and endogenous mouse embryonic globins, again without substantial perturbation of erythroid maturation or peripheral blood counts. These in vivo data demonstrate that NonO is required for maintaining embryonic and fetal globin silencing under physiological conditions and argue that the NonO-dependent repressive mechanism emerged early in mammalian evolution.\n\nFrom a translational perspective, NonO joins BCL11A, ZBTB7A (LRF), and SOX6 as a compelling target for HbF induction in β-hemoglobinopathies. The magnitude of γ-globin activation achieved by NonO knockdown in adult human erythroblasts—raising γ-globin from ~2% to ~12% of total β-like globin mRNA—approaches levels associated with clinical benefit in hereditary and pharmacologically induced HPFH. In principle, strategies that attenuate NonO function at the β-globin locus, alone or in combination with partial inhibition of BCL11A, could yield additive increases in HbF while distributing the burden of repression across multiple targets, potentially enhancing safety. However, NonO is a multifunctional protein implicated in RNA processing, DNA damage responses, neuronal development, paraspeckle formation, and innate immune sensing. Global suppression of NonO is therefore unlikely to be tolerated systemically, and future work will need to explore erythroid-restricted perturbations (for example, via genome editing of the γ-promoter octamer motif, locus-specific epigenome editing, or disruption of the NonO–SOX6 interface) rather than generalized NonO inhibition.\n\nSeveral limitations of the present work point to specific next steps. First, although we establish direct binding of NonO to the γ-promoter and show that NonO influences γ-globin transcription, the composition of the full NonO-containing repressor complex at the β-globin locus remains incompletely defined. Integrating NonO ChIP–seq with histone modification maps and chromatin accessibility profiles in primary human erythroblasts will be important for determining how NonO interfaces with BCL11A, NuRD, and other chromatin remodelers genome-wide. Second, our studies focus on steady-state transcript and protein levels; high-resolution single-cell and temporal analyses could clarify whether NonO primarily affects the probability of γ-gene activation, the amplitude of transcriptional bursts, or both. Finally, it will be critical to assess NonO perturbation in disease-relevant human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from patients with sickle cell disease or β-thalassemia, where the chromatin environment and selection pressures may differ from those in healthy donor cells.\n\nIn sum, our findings reveal NonO as an integral component of the fetal and embryonic globin silencing apparatus, acting through direct recognition of a γ-promoter octamer motif and cooperative interaction with SOX6 to stabilize a repressive chromatin state. The conservation of this mechanism across human and mouse, together with the substantial HbF induction achieved by NonO depletion in adult erythroid cells, underscores the existence of a multi-layered, modular repression network at the β-globin locus that is both mechanistically tractable and therapeutically exploitable. Further dissection of NonO-centered complexes at the γ-globin promoter should illuminate general principles of lineage- and stage-specific gene silencing and may open additional avenues for rational HbF reactivation therapies.",

    "text": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have transformed the treatment of certain B cell malignancies, yet their activity in solid tumors remains modest. In contrast to circulating leukemia or lymphoma cells, solid tumors present a convergence of barriers that limit CAR-T cell efficacy: poor trafficking and infiltration into dense stromal matrices, antigen heterogeneity and loss, and a profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment enriched for regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and inhibitory cytokines. Even when CAR-T cells reach the tumor, chronic antigen exposure and inhibitory ligands drive terminal exhaustion and loss of effector function, and current strategies that focus solely on optimizing CAR structure or intrinsic T cell signaling have only partially overcome these constraints. \n\nOne attractive strategy is to combine CAR-T cells with agonists of innate immune pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), such as toll-like receptors, RIG-I–like receptors, or the cGAS–STING pathway. These pathways can reprogram dendritic cells and myeloid cells, enhance type I interferon (IFN-I) production, and increase antigen presentation, thereby amplifying endogenous antitumor T cell responses. However, PRR agonists are typically delivered systemically or by intratumoral injection, where they engage receptors on both immune and malignant cells. In preclinical models, robust PRR signaling in cancer cells can paradoxically promote tumor progression and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade by inducing chronic IFN-driven expression of inhibitory molecules and shaping a suppressive myeloid compartment. Thus, the net effect of PRR stimulation reflects a delicate balance between beneficial signaling in host immune cells and deleterious signaling in tumor cells, as well as the magnitude and duration of the IFN response. \n\nEndogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) offer an opportunity to exploit this balance in a more physiological way. RN7SL1 is a noncoding RNA that normally forms the RNA scaffold of the signal recognition particle and is shielded from immune sensing by associated RNA-binding proteins. In breast cancer models, stromal activation increases polymerase III–driven RN7SL1 levels and generates “unshielded” RN7SL1 that is packaged into exosomes. When transferred to tumor or myeloid cells, unshielded RN7SL1 activates the cytosolic RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5 and triggers IFN-I–associated transcriptional programs that can foster tumor growth, immune evasion, and therapy resistance, particularly in T cell–deficient or immunosuppressed settings. These observations underscore that the cellular compartment in which RN7SL1 is sensed, and the context of the surrounding immune system, are critical determinants of its biological effect. \n\nT cells themselves are not only recipients but also producers of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Antigen-driven immune synapses between T cells and antigen-presenting cells are sites of polarized release of exosomes and microvesicles that carry T cell receptors, co-stimulatory molecules, and diverse RNA cargos, including microRNAs. EVs derived from T cells or CAR-T cells can be taken up by dendritic cells and other myeloid populations, altering their activation state and antigen-presenting capacity. This biology raises the possibility that CAR-T cells could serve as mobile, tumor-seeking delivery vehicles for immunostimulatory RNAs, coupling recognition of tumor antigens with local release of DAMPs in the tumor microenvironment while sparing distant tissues and minimizing exposure of tumor cells themselves. \n\nHere, we test the hypothesis that arming CAR-T cells with the immunostimulatory RNA RN7SL1 can enhance both autonomous CAR-T cell function and endogenous antitumor immunity in solid tumors. We engineer human and murine CAR-T cells to transcribe a 5′-triphosphorylated, highly structured form of RN7SL1 and show that this activates RIG-I/MDA5-dependent IFN-I signaling within CAR-T cells, driving effector-memory differentiation, expansion, and resistance to exhaustion. RN7SL1 is also sorted into CAR-T cell–derived EVs and is preferentially transferred to intratumoral dendritic cells and myeloid cells rather than to cancer cells, where it restricts the emergence of suppressive myeloid states, lowers Tgfb1 expression, and promotes dendritic cell subsets with a costimulatory, antiviral transcriptional program. These changes support the accumulation of endogenous effector-memory CD8 T cells specific for both CAR and non-CAR tumor antigens, enabling rejection of tumors with heterogeneous or lost CAR targets and durable protection upon rechallenge. Finally, we demonstrate that CAR-T cells can be further “multi-armored” to co-deliver RN7SL1 together with defined peptide antigens, thereby supplying both adjuvanticity and antigenic targets to “paint” poorly immunogenic tumors and overcome low neoantigen burden. Together, these findings establish immunostimulatory RNA cargo as a modular strategy to convert CAR-T cells into vehicles that both improve their own performance and orchestrate a broader endogenous immune response against solid tumors.",

    "text": "This study identifies the endogenous noncoding RNA RN7SL1 as a modular adjuvant that can be built into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells to simultaneously enhance their autonomous function and orchestrate a productive endogenous anti-tumor response. By engineering CAR-T cells to express unshielded RN7SL1, we show that pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling via retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) can be spatially and cellularly redirected away from tumor cells and toward hematopoietic cells in the tumor microenvironment. This rewiring of interferon (IFN) signaling addresses several canonical barriers to CAR-T efficacy in solid tumors: poor expansion and persistence, suppressive myeloid infiltration, paucity of high-quality neoantigens, and immune escape via loss of the CAR-targeted antigen. \n\n34464586_The_Immunostimulatory_…\n\nA first major conclusion is that RN7SL1 provides a cell-autonomous advantage to CAR-T cells by engaging an intrinsic type I interferon (IFN-I) program that favors effector-memory (CCR7⁻CD45RO⁺) differentiation, sustained proliferation, and resistance to exhaustion. CAR-T cells expressing RN7SL1 display a transcriptional and phenotypic profile enriched for effector/central-memory–like states and reduced expression of canonical exhaustion markers such as PD-1, TIGIT, TOX, and CD38, both early after infusion and at later timepoints. This is notable because chronic IFN-I exposure in T cells is often associated with dysfunction and exhaustion; here, the timing, localization, and magnitude of PRR activation appear tuned such that CAR-T cells receive sufficient innate “licensing” to support productive differentiation without collapsing into terminal exhaustion. These data support a model in which appropriately dosed, cell-intrinsic RIG-I/MDA5–MAVS signaling is a useful design axis for programming CAR-T differentiation trajectories, in contrast to conventional strategies that rely solely on costimulatory domains or cytokine transgenes.\n\nA second key insight is that RN7SL1 functions as an exportable danger signal delivered by CAR-T–derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are preferentially taken up by endogenous immune cells rather than tumor cells. When delivered systemically as a liposome-formulated RNA, RN7SL1 activates RIG-I in both cancer cells and hematopoietic cells, with tumor-intrinsic RIG-I signaling promoting tumor growth and impairing outcome in T cell–deficient hosts. In contrast, when RN7SL1 is expressed in CAR-T cells and released in EVs, transferred RNA is markedly enriched in CD45⁺ myeloid cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and T cells compared to cancer cells, and this bias is dependent on EV biogenesis and CAR engagement. Functionally, this selective routing of RN7SL1 uncouples the deleterious, cancer cell–intrinsic effects of IFN/ISG activation from the beneficial, myeloid- and DC-intrinsic consequences. The observation that RIG-I deletion in cancer cells improves responses to intratumoral RN7SL1, whereas RIG-I deficiency in the hematopoietic compartment or IFNAR blockade abrogates the benefit of RN7SL1-expressing CAR-T cells, mechanistically reinforces the notion that the same nucleic acid danger signal can be either tumor-promoting or tumor-rejecting depending on the cellular compartment in which it is decoded.\n\nThird, RN7SL1 reshapes the myeloid and DC landscape in a direction that is unusually favorable for T cell priming. Both RN7SL1 and a scrambled control RNA induce interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in myeloid cells, but only RN7SL1 limits the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cell–like states (MDSC.1, MDSC.2) and reduces expression of Tgfb1 across multiple myeloid subsets. In parallel, RN7SL1 increases the representation of plasmacytoid DC (pDC)-like populations and reprograms type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1) toward a gene-expression module enriched for co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, CD40, RELB, CD83) and depleted for inhibitory ligands (PD-L1, PD-L2, CD200). Functionally, bone marrow–derived DCs exposed to RN7SL1 or to EV RNA from RN7SL1-expressing CAR-T cells exhibit enhanced ability to prime OT-I CD8⁺ T cells, an effect that depends on MAVS, RIG-I, and IFNAR. These data argue that RN7SL1 is not a generic IFN agonist but rather a qualitatively distinct DAMP (damage-associated molecular pattern) that skews myeloid differentiation away from suppressive fates and toward an antiviral, costimulatory DC program that is particularly well-suited for cross-priming cytotoxic T cells.\n\nConsistent with these myeloid changes, RN7SL1 delivery by CAR-T cells promotes a remodeling of endogenous CD8⁺ T cell states in tumors from exhausted, TOX⁺ populations toward effector-like and effector-memory–like subsets expressing KLRG1 and/or TCF7, accompanied by an expansion of antigen-specific cells such as TRP2-reactive CD8⁺ T cells. Genetic and pharmacologic perturbations place DC1s, IFN-I signaling, and lymphoid egress at the center of this axis: Batf3 deficiency, IFNAR blockade, or FTY720-mediated trapping of T cells in lymphoid organs each attenuate the accumulation of effector-memory CD8⁺ T cells and diminish the therapeutic gain from RN7SL1-engineered CAR-T cells. Together, these data support a classic “in situ vaccination” model in which CAR-T cells serve not only as targeted killers but also as mobile adjuvant depots that condition intratumoral DCs, promote cross-priming in lymphoid tissue, and seed tumors with endogenous effector-memory T cells of diverse specificities.\n\nAn important translational implication is that RN7SL1-armed CAR-T cells are less vulnerable to immune escape via CAR antigen loss and can be further upgraded to co-deliver defined peptide antigens. In mixed tumors containing CAR-target–positive and –negative cells, conventional CAR-T cells fail to control overall tumor burden, whereas RN7SL1-expressing CAR-T cells, in combination with checkpoint blockade, achieve durable rejection and generate long-lived memory capable of clearing subsequent challenge with CAR-antigen–negative tumors. Engineering CAR-T cells to express and export the model SIINFEKL peptide demonstrates that the same EV machinery can be harnessed to distribute peptide cargo for major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) presentation by both tumor and host cells, expand Ova-specific T cells in vivo, and enhance clearance of antigen-heterogeneous tumors—particularly when peptide delivery is combined with RN7SL1-mediated adjuvanticity. Conceptually, this decouples the antigenic landscape of the tumor from its endogenous neoantigen repertoire: CAR-T cells can be programmed to import “missing” antigens and simultaneously provide the innate cues needed to make those antigens visible to the adaptive immune system.\n\nSeveral limitations temper the immediate clinical generalization of these findings. Most experiments utilize murine syngeneic tumor models with engineered expression of human CD19 or mesothelin and model antigens such as TRP2 and SIINFEKL; how RN7SL1 behaves in the setting of human tumors with heterogeneous stromal architecture, variable mutation burden, and complex treatment histories remains unknown. Although RN7SL1-expressing CAR-T cells were well tolerated in mice, sustained PRR activation and IFN-I signaling in humans could provoke cytokine release, off-tumor inflammation, or autoimmunity, especially in patients with pre-existing autoantibodies or tissue damage. Manufacturing constraints—such as maintaining controlled RN7SL1 expression during ex vivo expansion and avoiding inadvertent activation-induced cell death—will need to be addressed. Finally, while RN7SL1 appears to bias EV uptake toward immune cells in the examined models, this distribution may vary across tumor types, and incomplete exclusion of cancer cell–intrinsic signaling could reintroduce elements of the pro-tumorigenic ISG program observed with systemic RN7SL1 delivery.\n\nNonetheless, these data define a generalizable framework for “multi-armored” CAR-T cells that co-opt endogenous nucleic acid danger signals and EV biology to reprogram the tumor microenvironment. Rather than viewing IFN/PRR signaling as a monolithic pathway to be globally amplified or suppressed, our findings argue that its therapeutic value hinges on where, when, and in which cell type it is engaged. By embedding RN7SL1 and selected peptide antigens into CAR-T cells, we convert them into programmable adjuvant–antigen cassettes that can both sustain their own function and ignite a broader endogenous immune response against antigen-diverse or neoantigen-poor tumors. Extending this strategy to other structured RNAs, DNA sensors, or RNA–protein complexes, and testing it in humanized models and early-phase clinical studies, should help determine how far we can push the idea of CAR-T cells as both precision cytotoxic agents and architects of de novo anti-tumor immunity.",

    "text": "Human mobility is a fundamental determinant of how infections spread, how economies function, and how people access services ranging from health care to education. Quantifying where, when, and how often people travel underpins spatial models of infectious disease transmission, transportation planning, and evaluations of geographic equity in service provision. Recent advances in geolocated data—most prominently mobile phone call detail records—have transformed our ability to observe movements at population scale, complementing or supplanting traditional sources such as censuses, travel surveys, and traffic counts.\n\nAlongside these new data streams, a family of “spatial interaction” models has emerged as the workhorse for inferring flows between locations when direct observations are limited or unavailable. Classical gravity models describe flows as a function of origin and destination “masses” (typically population size) and a distance-decay term, and have been widely applied to commuting, migration, and disease spread. More recently, the radiation model was proposed as a parameter-free alternative grounded in the concept of intervening opportunities, and has been shown to reproduce a variety of mobility and communication patterns using only the population distribution as input. In practice, however, gravity models often remain more flexible in applied settings because their parameters can be re-estimated for each context, while the performance of the radiation model appears to depend strongly on the underlying spatial and demographic structure.\n\nMobile phone data from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have been particularly influential in illuminating mobility patterns that drive endemic and emerging infections. Studies in sub-Saharan Africa have used call detail records to identify parasite “sources” and “sinks” for malaria in Kenya, to inform elimination strategies, and more broadly to quantify how human travel links otherwise weakly connected regions. Such work has highlighted both the promise and the limitations of mobile phone–based mobility: these data can capture movements over large populations and long time periods, but are subject to biases in phone ownership, network coverage, and user behavior that can distort inferences if not carefully accounted for.\nRoyal Society Publishing\n\nDespite the centrality of mobility to applications in global health and development, most systematic evaluations of spatial interaction models have been carried out in high-income, relatively urbanized settings, or have focused on movements between large metropolitan areas. Comprehensive comparisons of gravity and radiation models using empirical mobility data from predominantly rural LMIC settings remain rare. This gap is important because the assumptions underpinning these models—including how distance penalizes travel and how population size attracts trips—may break down in sparsely populated landscapes with few urban centers, heterogeneous transportation infrastructure, and strong regional administrative or economic boundaries. Recent work on mobility proxies and epidemic modeling has further shown that model choice and calibration can have substantial downstream effects on predicted epidemic trajectories, especially when data are incomplete.\n\nRural regions of sub-Saharan Africa exemplify these challenges. Many countries in this region are characterized by a small number of densely populated urban hubs embedded within large, sparsely populated rural districts, with marked variation in road networks, economic activity, and health service availability. Human mobility in such settings is shaped not only by distance and population size, but also by urban–rural linkages, regional administrative and market structures, and seasonal labor and school calendars. Yet, in practice, gravity models are often implemented with a single parameter set fitted to all observed flows, implicitly assuming that the same relationship between distance, population, and travel holds for, say, rural-to-rural trips as for urban-to-urban or inter-regional journeys. Whether this simplifying assumption is adequate for capturing the range of mobility behaviors in rural sub-Saharan Africa has not been systematically assessed.\n\nHere, we address this gap by analyzing mobile phone–derived mobility patterns in four sub-Saharan African countries—Burkina Faso, Kenya, Namibia, and Zambia—that span a gradient of population density, urbanization, and regional structure, but share the common feature that most administrative units are predominantly rural. Using call detail records aggregated to the district level, we construct origin–destination matrices of daily trips and use these empirical flows to evaluate how well different spatial interaction models reproduce observed travel. Building on the classical gravity framework, we fit a series of increasingly flexible models in which parameters governing the influence of origin and destination population size and distance can vary by trip type, defined by urbanicity (predominantly urban vs predominantly rural districts), by region (within- vs between-region trips), or by their combination. In parallel, we compare these parameterized gravity models to the radiation model, which has been proposed as a universal, parameter-free alternative.\n\nBy systematically contrasting model variants across countries and trip types, this study aims to answer three related questions. First, to what extent does a single-parameter gravity model fail to capture salient features of mobility in predominantly rural African settings, such as elevated short-range travel and concentrated flows to regional hubs? Second, how much can model performance be improved by explicitly accounting for urbanicity and regional structure, and does the “best” model differ across countries with contrasting population and infrastructure configurations? Third, under what circumstances does the radiation model provide a competitive or superior description of travel, despite its lack of tunable parameters? Addressing these questions yields practical guidance for selecting and parameterizing mobility models in data-limited rural settings, where model-based estimates are often used as inputs to epidemiological and policy analyses. In doing so, the work contributes to a broader effort to ground human mobility modeling in empirical data from diverse geographies, rather than extrapolating assumptions calibrated in high-income urban contexts to rural populations that remain underrepresented in the current literature.",

    "text": "Our analysis of mobile phone–derived mobility patterns across four Sub-Saharan African countries shows that widely used spatial interaction models, when naively specified, systematically misrepresent key features of travel in low- and middle-income settings, especially in rural areas. In all four countries, a basic gravity formulation with a single global parameter set overestimated flows involving predominantly rural districts and failed to reproduce the pronounced excess of short-distance and intra-regional trips observed in the call detail records. Allowing parameters to vary by urbanicity and region markedly improved fit, with the most complex “regional–urbanicity” gravity model providing the best overall description of flows, although simpler variants were sometimes sufficient for particular trip types and settings. \n\nThese findings extend prior work on mobility modeling in two important ways. First, most applications of gravity models in low- and middle-income countries have either adopted parameter estimates from high-income settings or fitted a single parameter set, occasionally augmented with covariates such as income, road density, or trip duration. Our results indicate that this homogenizing treatment is inadequate in contexts where population density, infrastructure, and economic opportunities vary sharply over short spatial scales. The fact that stratifying parameters by urbanicity generally provided larger gains in model performance than stratifying by administrative region underscores that “where” people travel from and to (in terms of settlement type) is often more informative than “which province” they cross. Second, by fitting a consistent model hierarchy across four diverse countries, we show that the benefits of more flexible gravity formulations are not idiosyncratic to a single dataset but recur across different demographic and settlement patterns.\n\nThe heterogeneity in model performance across countries is itself informative. Namibia, Burkina Faso, and Zambia are dominated by predominantly rural districts, and in these settings the basic gravity model tends to substantially overpredict flows between rural areas. This suggests that barriers to rural–rural travel—whether economic, infrastructural, or social—are stronger than would be expected from population size and distance alone. In contrast, Kenya, with a larger share of urban districts and a more polycentric distribution of population, exhibited a greater proportion of urban–urban trips and a different error structure, including cases where the radiation model outperformed the basic gravity model. This divergence is consistent with the mechanistic assumptions of the radiation model, which relies on the distribution of opportunities within an origin–destination corridor; in landscapes with more homogeneous and dense distributions of intermediate populations, its assumptions may be closer to reality, whereas in highly heterogeneous or sparsely populated regions it can break down. The fact that the “best” model differs by country reinforces that there is no universally optimal mobility model: the appropriate level of complexity is contingent on underlying spatial and socioeconomic structure.\n\nFrom an applied perspective, these distinctions matter because mobility models are frequently used as plug-in components for downstream analyses where direct movement data are unavailable. In infectious disease modeling, for example, mis-specification of rural–rural and rural–urban travel can alter estimates of the force of infection and the inferred contribution of rural reservoirs to national epidemic dynamics, especially for pathogens such as malaria or measles that persist in sparsely populated regions. Overestimating rural connectivity could lead to overly diffuse allocation of control resources, while underestimating links between rural and urban areas might obscure key seeding pathways into major cities. Similarly, for health systems planning, education access, or disaster response, inflated estimates of mobility in remote regions may lead planners to assume that populations can reach facilities or shelters more easily than is actually the case. Our results argue for the routine use of models that, at minimum, differentiate between flows involving urban and rural districts when extrapolating mobility in data-poor environments.\n\nAt the same time, the analysis highlights that more complex models are not always necessary or even preferable. In Namibia, for several inter-regional and rural–rural trip types, a regional gravity model without explicit urbanicity stratification performed as well as or better than the fully stratified model, and in Zambia a relatively simple exponential gravity model provided surprisingly good estimates for many flows. This reflects a general statistical principle: increasing model flexibility can improve aggregate goodness-of-fit but may not uniformly improve predictive accuracy for all subsets of the data, particularly when some trip categories are supported by relatively few observations. For practitioners, an important implication is that model choice should be guided not only by global fit metrics such as deviance information criterion but also by the specific flows that are most relevant to the policy or scientific question at hand. A parsimonious, well-calibrated model targeted to those flows may be preferable to a more elaborate specification that performs marginally better overall but worse in the subset of interest.\n\nSeveral limitations of our study suggest directions for future work. The mobile phone data capture movements only among subscribers to a single operator in each country and are subject to known biases in phone ownership and usage by age, gender, and socioeconomic status. In rural areas, where phone penetration may be lower and shared devices more common, these biases could be particularly strong and might partly explain the apparent suppression of rural–rural travel relative to gravity-model expectations. Moreover, movements are inferred from changes in the most frequently used tower within districts over monthly windows, which will miss short, within-district trips and may conflate repeated commuting with infrequent long-distance journeys. Our urban–rural classification is based on population density thresholds at the district level, which may not fully capture functional urban areas or peri-urban zones. Finally, the analysis is effectively cross-sectional; we do not explicitly model seasonal changes in mobility associated with school calendars, agricultural cycles, or religious events, all of which are known to modulate travel in these settings.\n\nMethodologically, our approach could be extended in several ways. A natural next step would be to embed the gravity parameters in a hierarchical (multilevel) framework, allowing for continuous variation with district-level covariates such as road network density, night-time lights, or health facility coverage rather than discrete urban–rural or regional strata. This would permit partial pooling across similar districts and may improve predictions for sparsely observed areas. It would also be valuable to test more recent classes of spatial interaction models—including intervening-opportunity formulations, destination-choice models, and machine-learning-based flux predictors—within the same comparative framework used here, as well as to explore the temporal stability of fitted parameters across years or in response to shocks like epidemics or floods. Finally, systematically evaluating the transferability of fitted models—e.g., whether parameters estimated in one country or region can be ported to another with similar urbanization profiles—would help clarify when and how mobility models calibrated in data-rich settings can be responsibly applied elsewhere.\n\nIn summary, by leveraging mobile phone data from four Sub-Saharan African countries, we show that accounting for urbanicity and regional heterogeneity substantially improves the ability of gravity-type models to reproduce observed mobility patterns, particularly in rural areas where data are most scarce and uncertainty is highest. At the same time, we demonstrate that simpler models can suffice for certain contexts and trip types, offering a practical menu of options rather than a single prescriptive model. As mobility data and computational tools continue to proliferate, such empirically grounded guidance on model structure will be essential for generating realistic movement scenarios, improving forecasts of disease spread, and designing interventions that reflect how people actually move through space in low- and middle-income settings.",

    "text": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the most cytotoxic lesions encountered by cells, and their faithful repair is essential for preserving genome stability and preventing tumorigenesis. In vertebrate cells, homologous recombination (HR) provides an error-free mechanism for DSB repair by using an intact sister chromatid as a template. This pathway is particularly crucial in S and G2 phases, when replication-associated damage and stalled or collapsed replication forks are frequent. Defects in HR cause chromosomal rearrangements, genome instability, and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents, and they underlie a substantial fraction of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Central to HR is the formation of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments on resected single-stranded DNA, a step that both commits the break to HR and determines the efficiency and outcome of repair.\n\nThe tumour suppressor BRCA2 is a key mediator of RAD51 filament assembly. Through multiple BRC repeats and a C-terminal RAD51-binding region, BRCA2 delivers RAD51 to resected DNA and stabilizes nucleoprotein filaments, thereby promoting homology search and strand invasion. Loss of BRCA2 function abrogates RAD51 focus formation, severely compromises HR, and is generally incompatible with long-term cell viability. At the organismal level, germline BRCA2 mutations confer a high lifetime risk of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and other cancers, and BRCA2-deficient tumours display characteristic vulnerabilities, including sensitivity to interstrand crosslinkers, topoisomerase I poisons, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Despite the central position of BRCA2 in the HR pathway, however, the mechanisms that regulate its activity at sites of DNA damage remain incompletely understood.\n\nPhosphorylation-dependent signaling orchestrated by the apical kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related) is a major regulator of the DSB response. These kinases are activated by distinct DNA structures associated with DSBs and replication stress and phosphorylate hundreds of substrates on serine–glutamine (SQ) or threonine–glutamine (TQ) motifs. BRCA2 itself is known to be phosphorylated in a DNA damage- and cell cycle-dependent manner, and phosphorylation events within BRCA2 have been implicated in replication fork protection, checkpoint control, and HR efficiency. However, phosphorylation is inherently reversible, and protein phosphatases are increasingly recognized as active effectors rather than simple “off switches” for checkpoint signaling. How kinase–phosphatase crosstalk modulates BRCA2 function during HR, and whether this involves dedicated regulatory complexes, has remained unclear.\n\nProtein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major serine/threonine phosphatase implicated in a wide range of processes including cell cycle progression, chromosome segregation, and DNA damage responses. PP2A functions as a heterotrimeric complex composed of a scaffolding A subunit, a catalytic C subunit, and a variable regulatory B subunit that dictates substrate specificity and subcellular localization. The B56 (B′) family of regulatory subunits (B56α–ε) recognizes short linear LxxIxE motifs in substrates and substrate adaptors through a conserved binding pocket, thereby recruiting PP2A activity to defined signaling modules. B56-containing PP2A complexes localize to kinetochores, centromeres, and other chromosomal domains and have been shown to antagonize key mitotic kinases while also participating in checkpoint signaling and error correction. Yet, despite the broad involvement of PP2A-B56 in genome maintenance, a direct role for PP2A-B56 in HR-mediated DSB repair has not been established.\n\nBRCA2 harbours a conserved LxxIxE-like sequence between its first two BRC repeats, raising the possibility that it might function as a PP2A-B56-interacting protein. This region is poorly characterized compared to the canonical RAD51-binding modules, but its strong evolutionary conservation suggests functional importance. Whether this putative PP2A-B56 docking site is engaged during the DNA damage response, how its interaction is regulated, and what consequences it has for BRCA2-mediated RAD51 filament formation and HR have not been addressed. Moreover, cancer-associated missense variants cluster within this region in hereditary cancer cohorts, yet their functional significance and potential impact on therapy responses are largely unknown.\n\nHere, we identify a phosphorylation-regulated complex between BRCA2 and PP2A-B56 that is required for efficient HR-mediated DSB repair. We show that conserved SQ/TQ sites flanking the BRCA2 LxxIxE motif are phosphorylated by ATM and ATR in response to DSBs, and that these phosphorylations markedly enhance PP2A-B56 binding. Using biochemical reconstitution, Xenopus egg extracts, and human cell-based HR reporter assays, we demonstrate that PP2A-B56 is recruited to DSBs in a BRCA2-dependent manner and that disruption of BRCA2–B56 binding compromises RAD51 focus formation, HR efficiency, cell viability, and resistance to DNA damaging agents including PARP inhibitors. Finally, we provide evidence that cancer-associated BRCA2 missense variants within this regulatory module deregulate PP2A-B56 binding and sensitize cells to PARP inhibition, suggesting that the BRCA2–PP2A-B56 axis represents a clinically relevant layer of HR regulation. Together, these findings reveal PP2A-B56 as a positive regulator of BRCA2 function in HR and uncover a kinase–phosphatase-controlled signaling hub that couples DNA damage detection to the execution of homology-directed repair.",

    "text": "BRCA2 is essential for high-fidelity repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination, yet how its activity is dynamically tuned in space and time has remained poorly understood. In this study, we identify a conserved regulatory module in BRCA2 that couples DNA damage signaling by ATM and ATR to recruitment of the PP2A-B56 phosphatase complex, and show that this interaction is required for efficient RAD51 filament formation, homologous recombination, and cell survival after genotoxic stress. Together, these findings establish PP2A-B56 as a direct, positive regulator of BRCA2 function and uncover a kinase–phosphatase circuit that modulates the homologous recombination machinery.\n\nA central conceptual advance of this work is the demonstration that BRCA2 is not only a target of protein kinases but also an obligate platform for a specific phosphatase complex. Previous studies have implicated phosphorylation of BRCA2 and other homologous recombination factors by cell cycle kinases and DNA damage kinases in regulating repair pathway choice and timing, but the counteracting phosphatases have largely remained obscure. By mapping and functionally dissecting an LxxIxE short linear motif in BRCA2 that binds PP2A-B56, and showing that this interaction is essential for homologous recombination in the DR-GFP reporter system, for RAD51 focus formation, and for resistance to multiple DNA damaging agents, we define a direct route by which a PP2A holoenzyme engages the core recombination machinery. This extends the emerging view that PP2A-B56, previously best characterized in mitotic chromosome segregation and checkpoint control, also operates at DNA lesions to sculpt signaling and repair.\n\nOur data support a model in which DSB-induced activation of ATM and ATR promotes assembly of a BRCA2–PP2A-B56 complex at damaged chromatin. The region flanking the LxxIxE motif contains three conserved SQ/TQ sites that we show are rapidly phosphorylated in an ATM/ATR-dependent manner in response to double-strand breaks and interstrand crosslink repair intermediates. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal sites (S1123, T1128) markedly increases the affinity of BRCA2 peptides for B56 in vitro, and phosphomimetic 3DQ mutants show enhanced B56 binding in cells. Conversely, a 3AQ mutant with all three sites rendered non-phosphorylatable binds B56 poorly and functionally resembles the 2A motif mutant and the Δ1100–1131 deletion in assays of cell viability, DNA damage tolerance, and RAD51 focus formation. These observations argue that damage-induced phosphorylation of BRCA2 by ATM/ATR is not simply a negative regulatory modification but instead licenses PP2A-B56 engagement. The requirement for both an intact LxxIxE motif and a dynamically phosphorylated flanking region suggests a two-layered control logic that couples damage sensing to localized phosphatase recruitment.\n\nWhat might PP2A-B56 do once recruited by BRCA2? The phenotypes associated with disrupting the BRCA2–B56 interaction provide several mechanistic constraints. First, BRCA2 2A and 3AQ mutants retain RAD51 binding yet are defective in RAD51 focus formation, indicating that the PP2A-B56 complex does not primarily control the stoichiometry of BRCA2–RAD51 association but instead regulates the productive assembly or stability of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments at resected DNA ends. Second, the fact that a phosphomimetic 3DQ mutant largely supports RAD51 focus formation, CPT and PARP inhibitor resistance, while still showing partial defects in viability and MMC tolerance, suggests that PP2A-B56–dependent events are particularly critical for DSB repair steps downstream of interstrand crosslink processing and for coping with replication-associated breaks. One attractive possibility is that PP2A-B56 dephosphorylates BRCA2 itself and/or associated HR factors such as RAD51, PALB2, or RPA to promote a specific conformational or compositional state of the repair complex that is competent for strand invasion. Dissecting the direct substrates of BRCA2-bound PP2A-B56 will be an important direction for future work.\n\nThe combination of Xenopus egg extracts and human cell-based assays highlights that this regulatory axis is evolutionarily conserved and acts at bona fide DNA lesions. In egg extracts, BRCA2 depletion diminishes B56γ recruitment to DSB-containing plasmids, establishing BRCA2 as a major scaffold for PP2A-B56 at sites of DNA damage. In human cells, targeted disruption of PP2A-B56 binding—either genetically via the 2A or Δ1100–1131 mutations or functionally via a generic B56-inhibitory module—compromises homologous recombination in the DR-GFP assay and sensitizes cells to mitomycin C, camptothecin, and PARP inhibition. These phenotypes mirror, but do not fully recapitulate, the consequences of BRCA2 loss, consistent with the idea that the BRCA2–B56 module is specifically required for a subset of BRCA2’s repair functions. The partial nature of the defect may explain why variation in this region can be tolerated to some extent in the germline yet still modulate cancer risk and therapy response.\n\nOur analysis of cancer-associated BRCA2 variants within the B56-interacting region underscores the clinical relevance of this regulatory module. Missense substitutions that either increase (S1106R, T1116P) or decrease (T1128I) B56 binding in biochemical assays lead to reduced clonogenic survival and modest hypersensitivity to PARP inhibition, suggesting that both hypo- and hyper-recruitment of PP2A-B56 can perturb the finely tuned balance of BRCA2 regulation. These findings argue that variants in regulatory motifs, which are often classified as “variants of uncertain significance,” can exert functionally meaningful effects by altering the engagement of kinase–phosphatase circuits even when they do not grossly destabilize the protein. In the longer term, integrating motif-centric functional assays and phospho-dependent binding measurements into variant classification pipelines may refine risk estimation for BRCA2 mutation carriers and help identify patients who are particularly responsive to PARP inhibitors or other DNA damage–targeting therapies.\n\nSeveral limitations and open questions emerge from this work. We have focused on the major nuclear isoform B56γ, but the extent to which different B56 family members contribute to BRCA2 regulation across tissues and tumor types remains to be defined. Our study also does not address how BRCA2–PP2A-B56 activity is coordinated with other known regulators of BRCA2, including CDK-dependent phosphorylation, the BRCA1–PALB2 axis, and cell cycle checkpoints, nor does it resolve the full structural organization of the BRCA2–RAD51–PP2A-B56 assembly on DNA. Finally, while our cellular assays clearly demonstrate that disrupting the BRCA2–B56 interaction sensitizes cells to DNA damage and PARP inhibition, in vivo validation in mouse models and patient-derived tumor systems will be needed to determine how this pathway shapes tumor evolution and therapeutic response.\n\nIn summary, our results reveal that BRCA2 integrates upstream DNA damage signaling by ATM and ATR with downstream phosphatase activity by PP2A-B56 through a conserved, phosphorylation-regulated short linear motif. This regulatory module is required for efficient RAD51 filament formation, homologous recombination, and cellular resistance to genotoxic stress, and it is perturbed by clinically observed BRCA2 variants. These insights add a new layer to the regulation of BRCA2 and homologous recombination and point to the BRCA2–PP2A-B56 axis as a potential node for therapeutic intervention and biomarker development in BRCA2- and PP2A-B56–mutant cancers.",

    "text": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal human malignancies, with five-year survival in the low double digits despite incremental advances in surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The dismal prognosis is tightly linked to the near-universal presence of activating KRAS mutations, which occur in more than 90% of PDACs and arise early in tumorigenesis, where they drive both initiation and progression. Although direct pharmacologic inhibition of KRAS has recently become feasible for selected alleles, most PDACs harbor canonical KRAS^G12D, KRAS^G12V, or KRAS^G12R variants that remain poorly druggable. Consequently, there has been intense interest in targeting downstream effectors of KRAS, most prominently the RAF–MEK–ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, as a means to blunt oncogenic signaling in KRAS-mutant PDAC.\n\nClinical and preclinical studies of MEK and ERK inhibitors in PDAC and other RAS-driven tumors have shown that MAPK pathway suppression can slow tumor growth, but responses are typically incomplete and short-lived. Cancer cells rapidly restore ERK output through feedback and bypass signaling, rewire metabolism, or engage parallel survival pathways, while systemic inhibition of ERK signaling in normal tissues constrains dose intensity. These limitations have motivated efforts to identify rational combination strategies that selectively heighten the dependence of KRAS-mutant tumor cells on ERK signaling, or that exploit vulnerabilities unmasked when ERK signaling is attenuated, thereby expanding the therapeutic window for MAPK-directed agents.\n\nOne such vulnerability arises from oncogene-induced replication stress. Constitutive KRAS activation accelerates cell-cycle entry, perturbs origin firing, and remodels metabolism in ways that overload the DNA replication machinery, leading to stalled replication forks, DNA double-strand breaks, and chronic activation of the DNA damage response (DDR). A central node in this response is the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)–checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) pathway, which stabilizes stressed replication forks, restrains late origin firing, and coordinates S-phase and G₂–M checkpoints to preserve genome integrity. Genetic and biochemical studies have established that many oncogene-driven cancers become addicted to ATR–CHK1 signaling to buffer replication stress, and that pharmacologic CHK1 inhibition can induce catastrophic DNA damage and apoptosis preferentially in tumor cells with high replication stress compared with normal tissues.\n\nThese observations have spurred the development of small-molecule inhibitors of CHK1, including clinical candidates such as prexasertib, and numerous studies have explored combinations of CHK1 inhibition with cytotoxic chemotherapy or ionizing radiation. In PDAC, where replication stress is pervasive and standard-of-care regimens such as FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine-based combinations further challenge DNA replication, targeting CHK1 represents an attractive synthetic lethal strategy. However, the extent to which KRAS-mutant PDAC cells depend on CHK1 for survival in the absence of exogenous DNA-damaging agents, and how CHK1 inhibition interfaces with KRAS effector pathways such as ERK signaling, remain incompletely defined.\n\nIn parallel, KRAS-driven PDAC exhibits profound metabolic rewiring and an elevated reliance on autophagy. Autophagy supports tumor growth by recycling intracellular macromolecules to sustain mitochondrial function, anabolic metabolism, and redox balance in the nutrient-poor tumor microenvironment. Genetic and pharmacologic studies in mouse models and human PDAC cells have shown that autophagy is often required for tumor maintenance, and that autophagy inhibition can sensitize PDAC cells to chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and metabolic stress. ERK pathway inhibition has itself been reported to enhance autophagic flux as a compensatory survival mechanism, suggesting that autophagy may act as a critical buffer when KRAS–ERK signaling is perturbed.\n\nTogether, these lines of evidence point to a three-way interplay between oncogenic KRAS signaling, the ATR–CHK1 DDR axis, and autophagy in sustaining PDAC cell survival under conditions of replication and metabolic stress. However, a systematic definition of how the DDR modulates sensitivity to ERK inhibition in KRAS-mutant PDAC, and whether CHK1 inhibition alone is sufficient to expose therapeutically actionable liabilities in this context, has been lacking.\n\nIn this study, we use complementary functional genomic and pharmacologic approaches to delineate how KRAS-mutant PDAC cells depend on CHK1 and related DDR components, both at baseline and in the setting of ERK inhibition. Unbiased CRISPR–Cas9 and small interfering RNA loss-of-function screens identify multiple components of the ATR–CHK1 DDR pathway as modulators of ERK inhibitor sensitivity, with CHK1 emerging as an essential survival factor in KRAS-mutant PDAC. We show that pharmacologic CHK1 inhibition alone induces S-phase accumulation, extensive DNA damage, loss of MYC expression, and apoptotic growth suppression in PDAC cell lines and patient-derived organoids, while paradoxically activating ERK signaling and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and increasing autophagic flux. By combining CHK1 and ERK inhibition, and by further blocking autophagy, we demonstrate that concurrent suppression of DDR, KRAS effector signaling, and autophagy yields potent and, in many contexts, synergistic apoptotic growth inhibition. Finally, we leverage focused CRISPR screening to uncover an ERK-regulated DDR effector, the non-homologous end joining factor RIF1, as a key determinant of resistance to CHK1 inhibition. These findings establish CHK1 as a central vulnerability in KRAS-mutant PDAC and provide a mechanistic rationale for therapeutic strategies that integrate DDR, ERK, and autophagy inhibition in this recalcitrant disease.",

    "text": "Oncogenic KRAS drives pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) through a combination of mitogenic signaling and chronic replication stress, creating a dependency on intact DNA damage response (DDR) and stress-adaptive pathways. In this study, we identify the checkpoint kinase CHK1 as a non-redundant survival factor in KRAS mutant PDAC and define how CHK1 coordinates with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and autophagy to buffer oncogene-induced damage. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of CHK1 triggers S-phase accumulation, extensive double-strand DNA damage marked by γH2AX, and apoptosis in a large subset of PDAC lines and patient-derived organoids, with sensitivity modestly enhanced by KRAS mutation. These data support a model in which KRAS-mutant PDAC cells are “addicted” not only to ERK-driven proliferation but also to CHK1-mediated tolerance of replication stress. \n\nA central mechanistic implication of our work is that CHK1 inhibition in this context does not merely phenocopy generic DDR blockade, but rather precipitates a specific collapse of homologous recombination repair in S phase, coupled to failure of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) engagement. In CHK1 inhibitor–sensitive cells, we observe S-phase arrest, loss of 53BP1 foci, accumulation of pan-nuclear γH2AX, and apoptosis, whereas resistant cells retain 53BP1-positive NHEJ and avoid S-phase trapping despite losing RAD51 foci. This bifurcation suggests that the cytotoxic effect of CHK1 inhibition reflects a “double hit”: origin firing proceeds in the absence of proper CHK1-dependent checkpoint control, while both high-fidelity homologous recombination and compensatory NHEJ are functionally disabled in a subset of cells. The finding that ATR inhibition partially recapitulates these effects, but is generally less potent, is consistent with CHK1 acting as a more proximal effector node that integrates ATR signals with cell-cycle machinery and repair pathway choice.\n\nWe also uncover an unexpected, bidirectional coupling between ERK signaling and the DDR. On the one hand, chronic ERK activity sustains expression and phosphorylation of DDR components, including ATR, ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP), and CHK1, as well as the NHEJ regulator RIF1. ERK inhibition or KRAS depletion decreases both CHEK1 transcript and CHK1 protein, in part as a consequence of G1 arrest, and downregulates RIF1 transcription. This defines a KRAS–ERK–DDR axis in which mitogenic signaling actively maintains the DNA repair apparatus required to tolerate oncogene-induced stress. On the other hand, acute CHK1 inhibition produces a compensatory increase in ERK phosphorylation, mediated at least partly by AKT and by downregulation of the ERK phosphatase DUSP6. Thus, CHK1 and ERK form a mutually reinforcing circuit: ERK helps maintain DDR capacity, and DDR blockade feeds back to reactivate ERK and preserve survival. Our CRISPR screen for ERK substrates that modulate CHK1 inhibitor sensitivity highlights RIF1 as a key node in this circuit. RIF1 depletion phenocopies ERK inhibition in its capacity to sensitize PDAC cells to CHK1 blockade, and in resistant cells CHK1 inhibition enhances RIF1 recruitment to DNA damage sites. These observations support a model in which ERK-regulated RIF1 acts as a gatekeeper for NHEJ in the setting of CHK1 inhibition and suggest that RIF1 levels or activity might stratify CHK1 inhibitor responsiveness.\n\nA second major adaptive axis revealed here is metabolic: CHK1 inhibition activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibits mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), and increases autophagic flux. This mirrors our previous observation that ERK inhibition in KRAS mutant PDAC drives autophagy dependence, and it reinforces the idea that autophagy is a shared escape route from both mitogenic and genotoxic stress. Functionally, we show that chloroquine-mediated autophagy blockade augments the cytotoxicity of either CHK1 or ATR inhibition, and that triple inhibition of CHK1, ERK, and autophagy produces synergistic growth suppression and robust apoptosis in both cell lines and organoids while having limited effects on NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. These data position autophagy as a central, targetable survival program downstream of both MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and DDR perturbation and argue that dual or triple combinations directed at CHK1/ATR, ERK, and autophagy are mechanistically rational in KRAS mutant PDAC.\n\nOur findings also provide context for why prior clinical efforts to combine CHK1 inhibitors with genotoxic chemotherapy in PDAC have been disappointing. In those trials, CHK1 inhibitors were layered onto gemcitabine or radiation without concurrent inhibition of compensatory survival circuits. The current work suggests that, in KRAS-driven PDAC, ERK reactivation and autophagy induction represent dominant bypass pathways that can sharply limit the therapeutic window of CHK1 inhibition when deployed with conventional DNA-damaging agents alone. By contrast, our data show that ERK inhibition lowers the abundance and activity of CHK1 and RIF1, thereby functionally “pre-sensitizing” cells to CHK1 blockade, and that autophagy inhibitors prevent metabolic adaptation to combined DDR and MAPK stress. Rational scheduling of these agents—such as ERK priming followed by CHK1 inhibition and intermittent autophagy blockade—may therefore produce deeper and more durable responses than either strategy alone, though this will need to be rigorously tested in vivo.\n\nSeveral limitations of our study point to future directions. First, although we validate key findings in patient-derived organoids, the tolerability and efficacy of these combinations must be evaluated in genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC, where stromal constraints, hypoxia, and immune interactions may substantially influence both DDR and autophagy dependence. Second, our work focuses on a defined panel of KRAS mutant lines; broader profiling across KRAS alleles, co-mutation patterns (for example, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4), and baseline CHEK1/RIF1 expression will be required to derive predictive biomarkers. It will also be important to understand whether CHK1 dependence and ERK–DDR coupling extend to other KRAS-driven malignancies, including lung and colorectal cancers, or whether the extreme desmoplasia and hypovascularity of PDAC uniquely constrain repair options and metabolic flexibility. Finally, CHK1, ATR, ERK, and autophagy are all critical for normal tissue homeostasis; defining dose, schedule, and sequence that exploit the heightened replication stress and pathway co-dependencies of KRAS mutant PDAC, while sparing bone marrow, intestinal epithelium, and other proliferative compartments, will be essential for clinical translation.\n\nIn summary, we delineate CHK1 as a central vulnerability in KRAS mutant PDAC that is wired into both ERK-driven DDR support and AMPK–mTORC1–dependent autophagy. By demonstrating that ERK inhibition and RIF1 loss converge to sensitize cells to CHK1 blockade, and that autophagy inhibition prevents metabolic escape, we provide a mechanistic blueprint for multi-node therapeutic strategies against this otherwise refractory disease.",

Here we exploit the self-fertilizing mangrove killifish Kryptolebias marmoratus to perform a rapid forward genetic screen for tail mutants. N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis yielded two recessive lines, shorttail (stl) and balltail (btl), with complementary tail malformations. Mapping-by-RNA sequencing in an isogenic background identified missense mutations in noto and msgn1 as the sole candidate causal variants. In situ hybridization and transcriptome profiling reveal that noto is required for tail notochord formation and secondarily for tail somite and spinal cord gene expression, whereas msgn1 is essential for tail paraxial mesoderm specification. Cross-species morpholino and mRNA rescue in medaka, combined with Kaede-based lineage tracing, demonstrate that noto and msgn1 reciprocally control axial versus paraxial cell allocation within the tail bud. These findings uncover tail-specific functions for noto and msgn1 and establish K. marmoratus as a powerful vertebrate model for forward genetics.",

    "text": "Formation of the posterior body axis is a central problem in vertebrate development. As gastrulation concludes, the embryo must continue to generate new tissue from a confined posterior growth zone while preserving correct pattern, proportion, and tissue composition. In most species this process culminates in tail formation—a composite structure built from axial notochord, paraxial somites, spinal cord, and overlying ectoderm—whose size and architecture must be coordinated with the previously established trunk.\n\nIn amniotes and teleosts, much of posterior growth is driven by neuromesodermal progenitors, a bipotent population that produces both spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm as the body axis elongates. Work in mouse, chick, and zebrafish has shown that these progenitors are transcriptionally distinct from the earlier gastrula organizer and that the mechanisms operating during tail formation differ in important respects from those patterning the trunk, despite their superficial continuity. These studies have led to the view that the tail bud functions as a posterior organizer, integrating Wnt, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and retinoic acid signaling to coordinate continued axis extension, while progressively restricting neuromesodermal progenitors into neural and mesodermal lineages. \n\nKey components of the gene regulatory network that underpins posterior axis formation include the T-box transcription factors Brachyury/T and Tbx6, the basic helix–loop–helix factor Mesogenin1 (Msgn1), and the homeobox factor Noto. Together, these factors couple posterior Wnt/FGF signaling to presomitic mesoderm identity and to the specification and differentiation of the notochord and tail organizer. Genetic analyses in classical model organisms indicate that these regulators are deeply conserved, but their deployment and interactions vary along the anterior–posterior axis and between species, suggesting that tail-specific programs may have evolved by reconfiguring a common ancestral network. \n\nStudies in zebrafish and mouse have defined Noto (and its zebrafish orthologue floating head) as a central determinant of notochord fate. In mouse, Noto is required for node morphogenesis, caudal notochord formation, and proper axial skeleton development; loss of Noto leads to truncation or absence of posterior notochord, vertebral defects, and abnormal tail morphology. In zebrafish floating head mutants, the notochord is selectively lost while prechordal plate and other mesodermal derivatives form relatively normally, indicating that Noto activity is both lineage-specific and essential for axial mesoderm. These phenotypes are often more severe posteriorly than anteriorly, hinting that Noto plays a particularly important role in tail organizer function and in maintaining a coherent axial midline during the final phases of axis elongation. \n\nComplementary work has shown that Mesogenin1 acts as a master regulator of paraxial presomitic mesoderm. In the mouse, Msgn1 is a Wnt-regulated transcription factor that directly activates broad transcriptional programs defining presomitic mesoderm identity, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, cell motility, and segmentation; forced Msgn1 expression in neuromesodermal stem cells expands unsegmented presomitic mesoderm at the expense of both notochord and neural tube, whereas loss of Msgn1 disrupts somite formation and paraxial mesoderm differentiation. In zebrafish, mesogenin1 cooperates with the T-box gene spadetail to control tail somite formation, and combined perturbation of these factors selectively ablates posterior paraxial mesoderm. Together, these findings position Msgn1 as a critical node linking posterior Wnt signaling to tail mesoderm output. \n\nDespite this rich genetic framework, two important questions remain unresolved. First, how do axial (Noto-dependent) and paraxial (Msgn1-dependent) programs interact within the tail bud to ensure proper allocation and spatial segregation of midline and lateral progenitors—for example, through cell sorting between notochordal and paraxial domains? Second, why are tail structures often more sensitive than trunk structures to perturbations in these regulators? Distinguishing trunk- versus tail-specific requirements has been challenging in traditional vertebrate models, in part because of genetic redundancy, the need for complex mapping crosses, and the difficulty of rapidly identifying causative lesions in forward genetic screens.\n\nThe self-fertilizing mangrove killifish, Kryptolebias marmoratus, provides a powerful but underused platform to address these issues. This androdioecious species reproduces primarily by internal self-fertilization, generating highly inbred, effectively clonal lines that can be maintained indefinitely in the laboratory. Genetic surveys and population-genetic analyses have shown that many laboratory strains are extremely homozygous, enabling experiments that require genetically uniform vertebrate specimens. Embryos develop externally and have been staged and imaged in detail, establishing K. marmoratus as a tractable embryological model. More recently, a dense RAD-seq–based linkage map and reference genome resources have been developed, providing the necessary infrastructure for genetic and genomic analysis. \n\nHere we exploit these features to establish K. marmoratus as a complementary model for vertebrate tail development and as a platform for efficient forward genetics in a self-fertilizing vertebrate. Using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis in an isogenic strain, we isolate two recessive mutants with specific defects in tail outgrowth, shorttail (stl) and balltail (btl), which differentially affect notochord formation, paraxial mesoderm differentiation, and the organization of the tail bud. By applying pooled RNA sequencing and de novo transcriptome analysis to small numbers of mutant embryos, we identify the underlying lesions as missense mutations in noto and msgn1. Comparative expression analysis and tail bud lineage tracing in K. marmoratus and medaka then reveal that Noto and Mesogenin1 act in a mutually dependent manner to drive cell sorting between axial and paraxial tail mesoderm, and that tail tissues are preferentially sensitive to perturbations in this module. These findings delineate a conserved but flexibly wired gene network for posterior body formation and showcase the self-fertilizing mangrove killifish as a rapid, genetically accessible model for dissecting vertebrate tail organizer function.",

    "text": "Our study identifies the self-fertilizing mangrove killifish as a genetically tractable vertebrate model for dissecting the molecular logic of tail bud development and reveals an unexpectedly tight coupling between axial and paraxial mesoderm specification mediated by noto and msgn1. Using a single lane of de novo–assembled RNA sequencing in an isogenic background, we could resolve the causative missense mutations in noto in the shorttail (stl) line and in msgn1 in the balltail (btl) line and link them to selective loss or mis-patterning of notochord and somite derivatives in the tail. Together with expression analysis, cross-species morpholino phenocopy and rescue in medaka, and cell lineage tracing, these data support a model in which reciprocal activities of noto and msgn1 in the tail bud coordinate cell sorting between axial and paraxial domains to ensure robust posterior body extension. \n\nA central conceptual result is that the trunk and tail of K. marmoratus, although composed of the same canonical tissues, are patterned by distinct regulatory mechanisms. In both mutants, expression of notochord, muscle and neural markers is selectively disrupted in the tail while largely preserved in the trunk, demonstrating a regionalized requirement for noto and msgn1 in posterior tissue morphogenesis. The complete loss of tail notochord marker expression and progressive disappearance of the posterior axis in stl embryos, together with the enrichment of notochord-specific transcripts among the most strongly downregulated genes in the stl RNA-seq dataset, argue that noto is essential for establishing and maintaining axial mesoderm identity specifically in the tail bud. By contrast, the btl phenotype, with its enlarged, mis-shaped tail tip, reduction of somite markers and relative enrichment for muscle-associated transcripts among downregulated genes, indicates that msgn1 is primarily required for paraxial mesoderm differentiation and organization.\n\nThe reciprocal changes in noto and msgn1 expression in the two mutants suggest that these transcription factors do not act in isolation but instead participate in a local regulatory network that partitions the tail bud progenitor field. Loss of noto in stl leads to reduced noto expression and diminished msgn1 levels in the tail bud, consistent with a failure to stabilize axial identity and a secondary impact on paraxial progenitors. Conversely, the ectopic and expanded expression of both noto and msgn1 in btl implies that msgn1 normally helps constrain the spatial domain or level of axial and paraxial gene expression. This mutual sensitivity of the two genes to each other’s activity is further reflected in the double knockdown phenotype in medaka: combined depletion of noto and msgn1 collapses the tail into a ball-like structure with severe failure of progenitor deposition into both axial and paraxial compartments. These observations argue that balanced, spatially segregated activity of noto and msgn1 is required to maintain the architecture of the tail bud and that perturbing either component is sufficient to derail posterior axis formation.\n\nOur lineage tracing experiments in medaka provide a mechanistic link between this molecular circuitry and cell behavior. In wild-type embryos, Kaede-labelled tail bud cells disperse into both midline notochord and flanking somites over time, consistent with the tail bud functioning as a bipotent progenitor pool. In noto morphants, labelled cells are diverted away from the midline and accumulate in paraxial positions, whereas in msgn1 morphants, they are instead trapped near the midline and fail to populate somites. The double morphants largely retain labelled cells within a compact tail bud–like mass. These cell trajectory changes, which are highly reproducible despite modest sample size, support a model in which noto promotes axial identity and midline-directed movement while restricting paraxial fates, whereas msgn1 promotes paraxial identity and lateral migration while suppressing axial allocation. Disrupting either factor thus uncouples fate specification from directed cell movement, resulting in the characteristic shorttail or balltail phenotypes.\n\nOur work also places noto and msgn1 in the broader context of conserved tail bud regulators. Previous work in other vertebrates has emphasized the chordoneural hinge as a reservoir of progenitors that contribute to both spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm, controlled by a network that includes Brachyury/T and T-box and basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors. By focusing on a self-fertilizing teleost and combining unbiased mutation discovery with functional validation, we reinforce the idea that posterior axis formation is governed not only by generic “trunk” patterning genes but also by genes with disproportionately strong effects on the tail. The selective disruption of tail, but not trunk, notochord, somite and neural tissues in stl and btl underscores the existence of late-acting, tail-specific modules downstream or parallel to classical gastrula-stage patterning cues. Our cross-species morpholino phenocopies in medaka indicate that the tail-specific roles of noto and msgn1 are not idiosyncratic to K. marmoratus but instead reflect a conserved vertebrate strategy for partitioning axial and paraxial progenitors in the posterior embryo.\n\nBeyond developmental mechanisms, this study establishes a practical genetic framework for exploiting the unusual life history of K. marmoratus. The combination of self-fertilization, high inbreeding, and low background polymorphism drastically simplifies forward-genetic analysis: a single ENU-mutagenized F₁ hermaphrodite can generate an F₂ brood in which recessive zygotic phenotypes segregate without the need for outcrossing or family identification. In this context, “mapping-by-RNA-seq” becomes particularly powerful. By sequencing pooled mutants and siblings at the relevant developmental stage, assembling a de novo transcriptome and applying stringent allelic filters, we could reduce thousands of candidate variants to a single causative missense mutation in noto in stl and to two strong candidates, including msgn1, in btl. This strategy obviates the need for a high-quality reference genome or dense genetic map and can, in principle, be generalized to other phenotypes accessible to visual screening.\n\nThere are, of course, limitations. Our functional validation relies on antisense morpholinos in a heterologous species rather than precise genome editing in K. marmoratus itself, leaving open the possibility of species-specific differences or off-target effects. The small sample sizes in lineage tracing, dictated by technical constraints, call for future confirmation using higher-throughput live imaging or genetic reporters. Moreover, we have examined only two mutant loci in depth; it will be important to expand the repertoire of tail bud mutants to capture additional components of the regulatory network, including upstream signalling pathways and downstream effectors that mediate cell adhesion, polarity and motility.\n\nIn summary, by combining the genetic advantages of a self-fertilizing vertebrate with transcriptome-based mutation discovery and cross-species functional assays, we reveal a key role for noto and msgn1 in coordinating axial and paraxial mesoderm allocation in the tail bud. The shorttail and balltail mutants illustrate how subtle changes in the balance between axial and paraxial programs can generate qualitatively distinct posterior morphologies, while the double loss of both activities collapses tail formation altogether. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how vertebrate embryos sculpt the posterior body axis and position K. marmoratus as a complementary model alongside established teleost and mammalian systems for future work on the molecular and cellular basis of embryonic patterning.",
