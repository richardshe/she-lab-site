        <h2>Overcoming Epigenetic Silencing for Genome‑wide CRISPRi/a Screening</h2>
        <p>
        A major barrier to functional genomics in differentiated human iPSC models is the pervasive silencing of CRISPR machinery during development, an issue not resolved by standard safe‑harbor integration at loci like <em>AAVS1</em> or <em>CLYBL</em>.
        We developed and validated a new CRISPR platform that overcomes this problem, enabling sustained CRISPRi or CRISPRa activity throughout long‑term differentiation.
        </p>
        <p>
        Using targeted knock‑in strategies, we achieve persistent expression of dCas9 effectors across all three germ layers—including day&nbsp;35 cortical organoids, day&nbsp;18 cardiomyocytes, and day&nbsp;6 hepatocyte‑like cells.
        Functionally, we obtain ~99 % knock‑down of non‑essential surface markers such as CD81 across lineages.
        </p>
        <p>
        To add temporal control, we engineered degron‑tagged CRISPR systems using the SD40 degron, which enables rapid, tunable ON/OFF switching via a small‑molecule inducer.
        This platform supports both loss‑of‑function and over‑expression screening in stem‑cell models.
        We envision it as broadly enabling for genetic screens that refine differentiation protocols, enhance functional maturation, or promote in&nbsp;vivo survival.
        <strong>We’re actively looking for collaborators—please reach out if you'd like to give these tools a try.</strong>

        <h2>A Functional Genomics Map of Human Brain Evolution</h2>
        <p>
        The three‑fold expansion of the human cerebral cortex is perhaps the most defining feature of our evolution.
        This dramatic growth, which unfolded over just a few million years, enabled the emergence of language, abstract reasoning, and complex culture—but we still don’t know which genes or pathways actually drove it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our lab tackles this question head‑on by combining cerebral organoid models, genome‑wide CRISPR perturbation, and cross‑species comparisons.
        Using human and chimpanzee iPSCs, we grow 3D cortical organoids side‑by‑side and perform pooled CRISPRi/a screens to identify genes that regulate progenitor self‑renewal, neurogenesis, and differentiation dynamics.
        With a custom‑designed guide library that perfectly matches both genomes, we measure how each perturbation shifts the balance of cell types during development—then ask whether those effects are conserved or species‑specific.
        </p>
        <p>
        Top hits are prioritised for deeper characterisation using single‑cell transcriptomics, additional great‑ape species, and in&nbsp;vivo validation.
        The result will be a functional atlas of gene‑by‑species effects in early cortical development—offering new insight into both evolutionary innovation and neurodevelopmental vulnerability.
